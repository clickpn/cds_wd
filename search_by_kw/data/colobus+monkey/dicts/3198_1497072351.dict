VColobus Monkey Skull - Colobus monkeys are native to central Africa. This species gets its name, due to their reduced thumb size, from the Greek word colobus, meaning mutilated. However, this "mutilation" allows the colobus to move more freely through the tree-tops than other African monkeys. Colobus are unique in that their digestive system allows them to eat certain leaves and unripe fruit containing toxins that most other monkeys avoid.
