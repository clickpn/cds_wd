VElephant Shrew Skull -The long-eared elephant shrew, also called the red-rumped elephant shrew, is neither a shrew nor an elephant, but instead, belongs to the order Macroscelidae. The 15 species of long-eared elephant shrew get their name from their elongated snout and shrew-like size and appearance. Native to the savannah of sub-Saharan Africa, long-eared elephant shrews are mostly insectivorous; feeding on ants, termites and beetles.This original specimen resides in the Museum of Osteology collection.
