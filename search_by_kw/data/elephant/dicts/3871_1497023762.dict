VNorthern Elephant Seal Skull - The northern elephant seal is the largest pinneped in North America with males weighing up to 2,200 lbs. (1000kg.). This species ranges in the Pacific ocean from British Columbia to Mexico. The elephant seal is named for its exaggerated snout which is used by males in territorial and breeding battles. Elephant seals are a gregarious species. During the breeding season males and females congregate by the thousands where dominant males establish large harems.
