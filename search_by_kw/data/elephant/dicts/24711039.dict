Rectangular Marble Top Dining Table Marquetry Handmade Pietra DuraDESCRIPTIONSize 18" x 12" Or 1.5' X 1' FeetHistory of Inlay Art  ~The birth of Inlay Art began in Florence, Italy during the 16th Century. The Art of Inlay was brought to India by the Mughals in the 17th Century especially in Agra City. Introduced to India during the regime of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan Inlay Art was very popular in architecture as well as in sculptures. White marble monuments incorporated with Inlay Artwork were also  constructed. The most famous & well-known being the Taj Mahal.  The Taj Mahal, constructed by thousands of skilled  artisans, depicts the great art of inlay on a grand scale. The Taj Mahal is considered one of the most beautiful buildings in the world and the finest example of the late style of Indian Islamic architecture. The Mughal emperor Shah Jahan ordered it built in 1631 after the death of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The white marble exterior is inlaid with  semiprecious stones arranged in Arabic inscriptions (designed by a local artist Amanat Khan, who was Shah Jahan's calligrapher), floral designs, and arabesques, and the salient features of the interior are accented with agate, jasper, and colored marbles.The building, which was completed between 1632 and  1638, was designed to reflect the gardens of Paradise to which the faithful ascend. The entire complex, with gardens, gateway structures, and mosque, was completed in 1648.nlays Art is still very popular in India allowing  many artisans to earn their livelihood from this wonderful Art  . How the Inlays Art is Done  ~Precious and Semi-Precious Gemstones are set in  marble in such a way that they shine like gems set in a  ring.The technique of inlaying marble is essentially no  different from that used in the Taj Mahal.  The marble stone is first traced with the pattern  of brass sheet. The pattern may be of any shape, design or size. The quarried marble is then cut to size and painstakingly sculpted. Once the desired contours are achieved, small  indentation (grooves) are created by hand on the marble stone base  to hold the gemstones. The different colored stones, Precious and Semi  Precious, are cut as per the design/size of the Pattern . The cut stone fit perfectly into the marble. After the stones are set in place, the piece is polished to a rich luster.
