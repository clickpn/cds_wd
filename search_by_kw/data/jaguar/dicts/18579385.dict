Morningstar's Jewelers and Pawnbrokers will be celebrating its 54th year in business in the city of Hollywood in November 2012. However, the history of Morningstar's dates back to after the Civil War in America, when the first store originated in Mobile, Alabama. The City of Hollywood welcomed Morningstar's Jewelers and Pawnbrokers in 1958. Alex Morningstar and his son Louis began their family business in a small office loaning money on jewelry and other items of value. As the City of Hollywood has grown, so has the jewelry and pawnbrokering business. With his store located in downtown Hollywood, Morningstar's has served members of the community for generations. This family business was welcomed by its 5th generation in 1997, when Eric Morningstar, son of Louis Morningstar joined the organization. After graduating with a degree from Arizona State University, Eric went on to further his studies at the Gemological Institute of America in New York City. Come by and visit us at 2000 Hollywood Blvd. Hollywood, FL 33020. Please contact us with any questions before looking on an item. Important: please contact us prior to looking if you have zero rating. We guarantee the authenticity of all our watches and jewelry items.
