VMegantereon nihowanensis 4 1/2" Wide x 5 1/2" High x 10" Long Late Miocene to earliest Pleistocene, (6 - .9 mya) China. The genus Megantereon has a very long history in the fossil record. It is found throughout most of the world. About the size of a stout jaguar but with a longer neck, this dirk-tooth saber cat was most likely a formidable predator. Most authors agree that Megantereon was a direct ancestor of the infamous genus Smilodon.
