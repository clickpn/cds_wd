VJaguarundi Skull - Jaguarundi are small, uniformly colored cats native to Central and South America as well as the extreme southern United States. A jaguarundi's coat can vary from red to nearly black. This species is more active during the day than most species of small cats, inhabiting dense undergrowth. The carnivorous jaguarundi preys on various reptiles, birds, and small mammals. Habitat loss is leading to this species decline.
