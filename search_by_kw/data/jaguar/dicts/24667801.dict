V$75 LESS THAN OUR AMAZON PRICE.This posting is for a COMPLETE "ATARI JAGUAR" video game system, with two controllers and Team Tap adaptor for multi-player use, and 20 COMPLETE GAMES (19 COMPLETE IN BOX). System is Complete WITH 2 controllers, multi-player adapter called a TEAM TAP, plus the standard rf unit (sorry forgot to show in photos), and power supply. Atari Jaguar system itself is in VERY EXCELLENT+ condition as there are only minimal signs of aging or wear after over 20 years (this was well taken care of). GAMES:1. Cybermorph video game cartridge is in NEAR MINT & GLOSSY condition. Instruction manual is Intact and in EXCELLENT condition. Also comes with the controller overlay (sorry these and the systems hookups are not shown in photo BUT ARE INCLUDED). OTHER 19 GAMES ARE ALL COMPLETE IN BOX (so each of the following games come with the cartridges in their Original Box with Instruction Manual, and the very few games that were released with controller overlays will have them included as well. Only 3 of the 19 are missing the white cart holding trays.  Game boxes range from Fair to Excellent but still intact.  Cartridge trays range from poor to excellent, cartridges range from Good to Near Mint. Instruction Manuals range from Fair to Very Excellent but do ALL HAVE COVERS. I will not break down each game individually or it will take hours to list. This is sold as a bundle.COMPLETE IN BOX GAMES:2. Bubsy: Fractured Furry Tales3. Checkered Flag (no cartridge holding white tray)4. Club Drive5. Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story6. Evolution: Dino Dudes (no cartridge holding white tray)7. Flip Out! (most addictive game I've ever played).8. Hover Strike (this was released with a controller overlay, so yes it is included).9. Iron Soldier (this was released with a conttoller overlay, so yes it is included).10. Kasumi Ninja (no headband, those always got thrown away as who knows if the person before washed their hair)..11. Raiden12. Super Burnout13. Tempest 2000 (4 games in one, and they all are great).14. Theme Park (before Sim Theme Park, but still very fun).15. Trevor McFur in the Crescent Galaxy (this was released with a controller overlay, and yes it is included).16. Troy Aikman NFL Football (this is my favorite oldschool football title after the NES Tecmo Bowl games).17. Ultra Vortek (Mortal Kombat design/concept/and attempted gameplay).18. Val D'Isere Skiing & Snowboarding (no cartridge holding white tray)19. White Men Can't Jump20. Zool 2 (this was Atari's competition to Sonic the Hedgehog genesis games, same fast effects, collect food and dice instead of coins). EVERYTHING IS TESTED AND WORKS PERFECTLY.This was supposed to be a 64-bit system (years before the Nintendo 64 came out). However, the graphics are more dated. This system has plenty of fun games also. Shipping is $45 in USA.  Price INCLUDES Signature Deivery Confirmation and $800 Insurance.
