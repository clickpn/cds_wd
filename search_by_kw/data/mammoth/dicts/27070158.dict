VWE DO NOT SHIP PLANT OUTSIDE AUSTRALIAHow about growing some classic Halloween pumpkins for carving this year? The rounded shape and bright orange skins of this round pumpkin are perfect for the purpose, and so is its late fruiting season. This handsome autumn crop isn\u2019t just pretty \u2013 it tastes great too.
