VWE DO NOT SHIP PLANT OUTSIDE AUSTRALIAThey are eaten as raw, steamed or used in stir fries. The young tips of the plant can also be used in stir fries and can also be eaten as spinach!Snow Pea is a variety of pea eaten whole in its pod while still unripe.    The stems and leaves of the immature plant are used as a vegetable in Chinese cooking, stir-fried with garlic and sometimes combined with crab or other shellfish.They host beneficial bacteria, rhizobia, in their root nodules, which fix nitrogen in the soil- this is called a mutualistic relationship - and are therefore a useful companion plant, especially useful to grow intercropped with green,    leafy vegetables that benefit from high nitrogen content in their soil.
