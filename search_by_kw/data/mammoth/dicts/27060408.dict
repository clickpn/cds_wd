VWE DO NOT SHIP PLANT OUTSIDE AUSTRALIAEat your giant snowpeas whole in salads and stir fries, and grow enough for freezing too. The sweet, crunchy pods are about 10cm long and the plants produce heavily. This heritage variety is supremely disease resistant and trouble-free. Get a rewarding harvest in return for a minimum of effort.
