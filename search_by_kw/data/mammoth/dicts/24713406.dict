It is an ideal treat for large breeds and makes an impressive gift item. Hard bones are a natural way to clean teeth and exercise muscles. They improve the dog's dental health by giving the dog a chance to exercise gums and scrape teeth. Natural bones can be fed anytime as a snack or reward as a substitute for chewing furniture (especially useful for teething puppies!) to occupy a dog during travel time or to help alleviate separation anxiety. They provide an enjoyable chewing experience and satisfy a dogs natural carnivorous instincts.Contents: 1 Extra Large Femur Bone wich measures approximately between 14 tio 16 inches.Be sure to add me to your favorites list!Powered by eCRATER .
