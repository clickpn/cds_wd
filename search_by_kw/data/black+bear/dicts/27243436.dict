VThis is a officially licensed black and white 16x20 photo which has been personally signed by Hall of Fame player Gale Sayers. Although his career was short, only 7 seasons, he dazzled everyone during his rookie season especially and throughout his career. During the 1965 season he scored 22 touchdowns including 6 in one game vs the 49ers. Elected into the Hall of Fame in 1977. This was signed at our public signing in Westminster, CO on January 27, 2008 and includes a certificate of authenticity from DenverAutographs.com.
