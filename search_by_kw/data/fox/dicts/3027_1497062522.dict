VBat-eared Fox Skull - The bat-eared fox , native to the African savanna, is named for its large bat-like ears. The teeth of this largely insectivorous species are much smaller than teeth of other canid species. In addition, the bat-eared fox is unique in having extra premolar and molar teeth giving them a dental count higher than all other canids. Bat-eared foxes are nocturnal and live in small groups consisting of breeding pairs and their offspring.
