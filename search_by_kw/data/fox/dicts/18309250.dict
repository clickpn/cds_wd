Filmed in Panavision.George Lucas's epic saga continues with this spellbinding sequel, one of the highest grossing films of all time. In a spectacular opening battle scene, the Rebel Forces--successful at the Battle of Yavin in Episode IV--are dealt a crushing blow on the ice planet Hoth. The Empire--now led by the evil Sith Lord Darth Vader--seeks vengeance for its recent disgrace, and the heroes snowspeeders and ion cannon are no match for the advancing Imperials seemingly unstoppable AT-AT Walkers. Forced to flee their Echo Base, Princess Leia and Han Solo escape on the Millennium Falcon, only to be pursued by the Imperial Star Destroyer, as Luke Skywalker--now guided by the Force and the spirit of Obi-Wan, heads for Dagobah seeking training from the wise Master Yoda to become a true Jedi Knight.  Meanwhile Vader is scheming to lure Luke to the Dark Side of the Force, or kill him in a final showdown duel, in which Luke learns a terrible secret that will shape his destiny.  Masterful storytelling weaves multiple plotlines that culminate in a betrayal at Lando Calrissian's Cloud City, capture of the Falcon's crew, Han being handed over to the mysterious Bounty Hunter Boba Fett and Luke--alerted to their plight--flying into the trap against the warnings by his new mentor that impatience leads to the Dark Side.  Greek tragedy meets a philosophical hero's journey in Episode V of the Original Star Wars Trilogy--a remarkable sci-fi epic in which the performances are as powerful as the special effects, action and imagination.  The first appearance of YODA, one of the most delightful, ingenious and instantly successful characters ever to light up a movie screen, helped to highlight EMPIRE as one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. RETURN OF THE JEDI - The circle is now complete and multiple storylines finally resolved in the third and final chapter of the STAR WARS saga. Luke must save Han Solo from the clutches of the monstrous Jabba the Hut, and bring down the newly reconstructed, even more powerful Death Star. With Solo imprisoned in carbonite, Luke accompanies his faithful droids in a rescue bid, with Princess Leia (in Boussh disguise) and Chewbacca (captive in chains) also lending a hand. After a successful, though narrow rescue by the victorious heroes, there is little time to celebrate. Luke returns to his Jedi Knight training with Yoda, only to find him on his death bed on Dagobah.  Luke vows to confront Vader (aka his Father).  Meanwhile, the Rebel Troops amass in an attempt to see off this new DeathStar threat and perhaps put an end to the Emperor Palpatine's evil once and for all.  Little do they know, the crafty former Darth Sidious has secretly given them this latest information so that he may crush the Rebels once and for all! With the operation led by Captain Solo underway, Luke leaves the safety of the Ewok village to face his true Father and somehow turn him to the light.  As he engages in final confrontation with his light saber-wielding enemy, some surprising revelations await the young warrior on his path to true balance of the Force.
