VRed Fox Skull - The red fox is native to North America, Europe and most of Asia and has been introduced to Australia and Africa. Although a member of the order Carnivora, the red fox is essentially an omnivore. It mostly eats rodents, lagomorphs, insects, fruit and occasionally carrion. Red foxes have a characteristic manner of hunting mice. The fox stands motionless, listening and watching intently for a mouse it has detected. It then leaps high and brings the forelimbs straight down forcibly to pin the mouse to the ground.
