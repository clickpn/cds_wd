It gets its name from its bulbous eyes which protrude outward from the side of its head. The walleye is popular among anglers for its size, fight and delicious meat, and is most commonly fished for at dawn, dusk, or during choppy waved weather, when the walleye tends most often to feed. The walleye can grow upwards near 3 feet in length, and is typically gold, grey-green and light brown in color.
