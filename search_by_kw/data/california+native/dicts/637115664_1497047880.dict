VThis is an AUTHENTIC HAND SIGNED ORIGINAL 12 1/2"x 12 1/2" complete album cover and vinyl LP record of the original recording by singers/songwriters/ musicians "LOGGINS & MESSINA - NATIVE SONS" - featuring the autographs by KENNY LOGGINS and JIM MESSINA. "Native Sons" is the sixth and final studio album (and seventh overall release) by singer/songwriter duo Loggins and Messina, released in January 1976. It was a departure from previous recordings owing to the presence of string sections, stronger emphasis on flute, minimized use of saxophone, downplayed country influences and Jim Messina's signature guitar work was barely in evidence. After a final concert in Hawaii, the duo quietly went their separate ways. The Messina-penned rock and roll song "Boogie Man" was later covered by Australian rock band The Blue Echoes.This is an awesome autographed piece of music memorabilia.
