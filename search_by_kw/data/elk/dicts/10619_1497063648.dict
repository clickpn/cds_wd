A bull elk's antlers may reach 4 feet above their head, so that the animal towers up to 9 feet tall. Bull elk lose their antlers in the early spring, but they begin to grow them back only a handful of weeks later in preparation for the late-summer breeding season. In early summer, elk migrate to high mountain grazing grounds where the cows  give birth. During the late summer breeding season the bugling of bull elk echoes through the mountains. These powerful animals strip the velvet off their new antlers using them in violent clashes that determine who gets to mate with whom. Males with the bigger antlers, typically older animals, usually win these battles and dominate small herds.
