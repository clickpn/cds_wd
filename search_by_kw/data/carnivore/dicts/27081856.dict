VSarracenia x catesbaie is also known as the Catesby's Pitcher Plant. This is an unusual pitcher plant that is a naturally occurring hybrid which lives on the plains of America.    Fully-grown pitchers turn a beautiful red and yellow colour.    They can reach up to around 40cms tall.    Might also produce 'flying saucer'-shaped flowers if grown in full sun.    Sarracenia are carnivorous pitcher plants that attract insects by mimicking flowers. Insects land on sugar-exuding glands called extra floral nectaries.    This is strongest near the pitcher opening, which is a dangerous place for incoming insects!    They land on either the pitcher lip or lid - both brightly coloured.    The insects are then tempted to venture inside where they are devoured by the plant!    The red flushed trumpets on this particular variety with therefore eat your unwanted flies!    Easy to keep, likes to be moist (use rainwater rather than tap water) and away from direct sunlight.    Sold in an 8.5cm pot. WE DO NOT SHIP PLANT TO USA
