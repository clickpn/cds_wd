VCarnivorous Plant. Sarracenia 'Tygo', Trumpet PitcherThe Tygo variety is a hybrid Sarracenia, and is characterized by tubular and light green leaves with yellow-orange shades, streaked in brown and with 5-petalled inflorescences. These are carnivorous plants which lure preys into their funnel-shaped leaves full of water, thanks to their juicy secretions and bright colours; the unfortunate insects drown and are digested by the plant, which in turn gets the nitrogen-based food it needs. This carnivorous species is hardy, perennial and evergreen, easy to be grown even by the less expert. The only necessary precautions to follow for its cultivation include: guarantee a high humidity level (in nature, Sarracenia lives in swamps), exclusively use purified water or rainwater, place it in well-lit environments (even in full sun), and promptly prune the dead leaves to avoid the formation of unpleasant and harmful moulds.
