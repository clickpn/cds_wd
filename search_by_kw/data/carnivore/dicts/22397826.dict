VA personalized, signed copy of Cultivating Carnivorous Plants includes growing guides and information chapters on all the carnivorous plants you could want: Aldrovanda, Brocchinia, Catopsis, Cephalotus, Darlingtonia, Dionaea, Drosera, Drosophyllum, Genlisea, Heliamphora, Nepenthes, Pinguicula, Roridula, Sarracenia, Triphyophyllum, and Utricularia.Cultivating Carnivorous Plants was designed to take the best elements from every carnivorous plant book I could get my hands on (and some non-carnivorous plant books) and improve upon those elements. To that end, you'll see short growing guides for each subgroup within a genus supplemented by detailed discussion of some common plants and tables following chapters that provide even more information. For example, want to know about Pinguicula chilensis? It's from Chile and Argentina, and I'd treat it as a "subtemperate" species. Oh, and by the way, it commonly grows in "damp, peaty meadows or the edges of pool and lakes formed by melt water from glaciers in the south Andean highlands at altitudes from 3,280 -7,218 ft. (1,000 - 2,200 m)."I also tried to provide detailed chapters about carnivorous plants, such as Roridula, which aren't discussed at length in  other books. I really wanted to include those genera because many growers - especially slightly advanced growers - are starting to branch out and starting to try more than the common species. This is really a fantastic book that you should have on your shelf if you're at all interested in carnivorous plants.
