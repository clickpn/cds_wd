VThe Venus Flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) is a small plant that catches and digests insects. The plant's leaves (terminal lobes) have tiny hairs, which trigger the trap to close when an insect comes close.    The trapping mechanism is so specialised that it can distinguish between living prey and non-prey stimuli such as falling raindrops.    Great for keeping indoors, it's a fascinating plant to study.    Can also be kept in a conservatory or greenhouse but keep out of direct sunlight.    Easy to keep, likes to be kept moist..    Use rain water rather than tap water.    Sold in a 8.5cm pot.    Please note: these plants are small. The mature size isn't likely to exceed 13cm. WE DO NOT SHIP PLANT TO USA
