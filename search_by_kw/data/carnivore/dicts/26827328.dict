VVenus flytrap plantDionaea Muscipula, more commonly known as a Venus flytrap, is probably the most well-known carnivorous plant and it feeds mainly on insects and arachnids.The Venus flytrap is a small plant that has 4-7 leaves that grow from a short subterranean stem. The leaf blade is divided into two regions: a flat, long, heart shaped, photosynthesis capable petiole, and a pair of terminal lobes, hinged at the midrib, forming the trap which is actually the true leaf. The inner surfaces of these lobes contain a red pigment and the edges secrete mucilage.These lobes exhibit rapid plant movement by snapping shut when special sensory hairs are stimulated. The plant is so advanced that it can tell the difference between live stimulus and non-living stimulus. The lobes snap shut in about 0.1 seconds. They are fringed by stiff thorn-like protrusions or cilia, which mesh together and prevent large prey from escaping. Once prey is unable to escape and the inner surfaces of the lobes are continuously being stimulated, the edges of the lobes grow or fuse together, sealing the trap and creating an enclosed \u201cstomach\u201d in which digestion and absorption can take place.Place the plant in a sunny location receiving at least six hours of direct sunlight. Ideal temperatures range between 60ºF to 85ºF (15.5ºC to 29.6ºC). The beautiful coloring of the pitcher plant will be much more intense if the plant receives at least a couple hours of bright, full sunlight each day, but will also grow reasonably well in partial shade. Most people grow pitcher plants in a greenhouse environment or in a terrarium.[4]You can make an inexpensive version using a saucer and a soda bottle; cut off the top of the bottle and place upside down over the plant on a saucer.[5] The garden will only be suitable where it replicates the exact environment where pitcher plants grow naturally.Inadequate lighting is a common cause of killing pitcher plants in the homegrown environment. If you don't have a greenhouse or humid, sunny space for the plants, consider using artificial lighting. Illuminating with several cool or warm whitefluorescent bulbs placed 12" (30 cm) from the plant will assist.[6]Only place hardier pitcher plants in a windowsill, and even then, only if you have adequate sunshine and humidity. While bathrooms are wonderfully humid, their windows are usually too dark to provide the amount of light required by the pitcher plant.[7] Hardier pitcher plants include sundews, bladderworts, and butterworts. A Venus flytrap probably won't like being situated on a windowsill.[8]Air-conditioning makes the room too dry for pitcher plants.Provide good drainage soil. A good soil is one composed of a one to one mixture of peat moss and perlite or combine Sphagnum moss, charcoal and orchid bark. The type of soil and the ratios, however, should be researched very carefully for the type of pitcher plant you have. If your pitcher plant doesn't like the soil, it won't thrive and will die. Don't use potting mix or fertilizers \u2013 pitcher plants are primed for poor soil and rich soil will be an overload.Maintain the pitcher plant's well-being. Besides watering, humidity, and feeding, keeping the pitcher plant in good shape requires that you ensure it has room to grow and is protected:Clip off all the dead leaves with scissors when the winter dormant period begins. Their dormant period varies by species, but is normally about 3-5 months during the winter. During this time, they should be kept cool and drier than normal.Protect outdoor pitcher plants. Leave any developing pitchers in the pot or provide thick mulch of leaves and cover with plastic or a container in hardiness zones six to eight during the winter months when left outside.Divide and re-pot the plant when the pitcher comes out of dormancy before rapid growth for new plants and begin the cycle over again. Pitcher plants can live for several years if cared for properly.Keep the soil very wet during the growing season, from May through October. A drained pot should sit in 1 inch (2.5 cm) of standing water. Don't let the plants dry out completely. Make sure the water you use is either rainwater or distilled, with low levels of salts. Aerating the water before watering the plant can help the plant grow. To aerate the water, fill a container half full with water, seal it, and shake it vigorously.Keep the habitat humid. Pitcher plants can tolerate low humidity, but they usually stop making pitchers if the humidity is inadequate. About 35 percent humidity is fine for the plants. Greenhouses and terrariums can provide the needed humidity, but be sure to provide the proper ventilation so the air does not overheat or become stagnant.Feed the plant. If the pitcher plants are growing somewhere without access to insects for an extended period of time, you can add a few small insects, such as a fly, or a cockroach, to a mature plant. However, this is usually not needed. Many types benefit from adding a small amount of a balanced soluble fertilizer to the pitcher (e.g. Miracid mixed 1/8 teaspoon per quart of water). Add this solution only to the pitchers until they are 3/4 filled.
