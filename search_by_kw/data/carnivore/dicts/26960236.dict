VSundews, also known as Drosera, are a species of carnivorous plant. These plants are often considered to be the easiest indoor carnivorous plants to grow mainly because the way they catch an insect (by secreting a sticky substance from their leaf tentacles) makes feeding easy. If an insect lands on one of the leaf's sticky tentacles, they may get stuck and the Sundew would wrap its tentacle up and digest the content.Keep the sundew at a temperature of 45-90ºF/7-32C or sub-tropical conditions. The more light shone on the plant, the better. Place the plant near your window so it gets enough sunlight. High humidity is not needed, so anything up to 50%RH would be fine.The sundew should be placed in a well lit place. It should receive direct sunlight for at least half the day. Be aware, too, that the dew or the sticky substance may dry up.Feed the plant once every two weeks. If your plant is situated indoors, you'll need to hand feed it. Feed it some dead insects or live insects, such as an ant. Feed the plant only fresh bugs.The sundew is not able to digest meat, so do not feed it any.Do not feed the plant an insect that is bigger than the plant's tentacle, or it could escape (and you'll have to catch it) or it will simply be too large for the plant to digest.Don't overfeed the plant if it is living in a high humidity environment. Doing so might promote mold growth, killing the leaves.If you place the plant outside, it will most likely feed itself, hence feeding is not required.During summer or late spring, five-petaled flowers will start to bloom. You may notice the sundew is not doing much at this stage due to the energy expended in making the flower. When the flower has developed, you can place the plant outside so a bee or other insect can transfer the pollen from plant to plant. The flowers are usually red, pink or white and will self-pollinate if they are not pollinated by another insect first.Seeds might develop and these are known to come out better if you cross-pollinate by rubbing the pollen from one plant against another flower's stigma.Water the plant. A sundew's roots are often weakly developed and most water is taken in through the leaves. Therefore, spray the plant with an inch or two of mineral-free or distilled water once every week. Remember not to spray too much or drown the plant. Too much moisture or water will rot the roots.Do not use any other type of water (such as tap water), as there may be excess minerals which build up and may kill the plant. If you do over-water the plant, invert the pot and plant while pressing down on the soil to squeeze out the extra water.If you have chosen to grow the plant in a terrarium (even though the plant will grow better outside), remember that you have to feed it. Since the terrarium is enclosed, few insects will be able to get in there and you'll be the sole provider of food.You can control the light intensity inside of a terrarium. This is another reason a terrarium might be a good choice for your sundew.If you put the sundew outside, remember to check it every day to see if the plant has been attacked. Check for diseases at this time, too. Put the sundew in a well-lit location where the plant can receive direct sunlight for part of the day, yet also have a bit of shade.
