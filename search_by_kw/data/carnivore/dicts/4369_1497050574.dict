VAllosaurus is a genus of large theropod dinosaur that lived 155 to 145 million years ago, in the late Jurassic period (Kimmeridgian to Tithonian). The name Allosaurus means "different lizard". The first remains that can definitely be ascribed to this genus were described in 1877 by Othniel Charles Marsh. As one of the first well-known theropod dinosaurs it has long attracted attention outside of paleontological circles. It has also been a lead dinosaur in several films and documentaries. This specimen has been pictured with a real human skull to show relative size only, and is not included.
