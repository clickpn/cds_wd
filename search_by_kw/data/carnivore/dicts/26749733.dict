VTropical butterworts, Pinguicula, are native to Mexico Cuba, Haiti, Central America and subtropical regions of Florida. They come in all shapes and sizes. Some produce a rosette of large broad leaves that reaches a diameter of 6 inches, while others are a diminutive inch across. Some even produce long thin leaves that resemble Medusa's hair on a good day. One thing that you can count on, however, is that all tropical butterworts produce gorgeous flowers.
