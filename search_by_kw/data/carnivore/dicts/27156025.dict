The traps are covered inside by tiny hairs and a sticky sweet smelling substance attractive to insects. When an insect touches the trigger hair, the trap is activated and closes around it's victim. After digestion of it's meal (whick takes several days), the trap will open again for a new catch. Keep moist at all times, rainwater or distilled water are preferred. Plants should not be fertilized (so therefore should be separated from your other plants). The insects it catches provide natural nourishment. Select a sunny window for your Venus Flytrap. In replanting only use sphagnum! Peat moss will do in a pinch. You will receive an acrylic Bio-Dome terrarium (4" x 4"), planted with a live Venus Fly Trap, spaghnum moss. The color of the base of the bio-dome may vary. Due to the nature of the Venus Fly Trap you can expect some damage to the traps in shipping. Simply trim them off and new ones will quickly sprout.
