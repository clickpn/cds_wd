VPygmy Sperm Whlale Skull - The pygmy sperm whale, kogia breviceps , was once thought to be a larger form of the dwarf sperm whale, kogia simus . Now accepted as a distinct species, the pygmy sperm whale is found throughout much of the worlds tropical and temperate oceans. This species, as well as the sperm whale and the dwarf sperm whale, possesses a spermaceti organ from which it gets its name. This species feeds on squid crustaceans and small fish.
