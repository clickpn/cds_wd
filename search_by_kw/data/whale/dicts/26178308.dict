Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out!\u2019\u2018That must be the same that some call Moby Dick,\u2019 said Tashtego, the Indian.\u2018Aye, aye,\u2019 shouted the captain, \u2018it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now.  Aye, and I\u2019ll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round perdition\u2019s flames till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out!  That is what ye have shipped for, men!\u2019  Ahab told the motley crowd that made up his crew, as they set out to wreak the captain\u2019s vengeance on the sea monster that had crippled him in a former fight.Filled with hatred, and armed with a harpoon barbed with finest steel and tempered in the blood of pagans, the captain directed the search for the white whale.Generations of adventure-lovers have thrilled to the stirring tale of the fight between Moby Dick and the captain\u2019s crew, with its dramatic conclusion.CONTENTSILOOMINGSIITHE CARPET-BAGIIITHE SPOUTER-INNIVTHE COUNTERPANEVTHE STREETVIA BOSOM FRIENDVIINIGHTGOWNVIIIBIOGRAPHICALIXWHEELBARROWXCHOWDERXITHE SHIPXIITHE RAMADANXIIIHIS MARKXIVTHE PROPHETXVALL ASTIRXVIGONE ABORDXVIIMERRY CHRISTMASXVIIIKNIGHTS AND SQUIRESXIXAHABXXENTER AHAB; TO HIM, STUBBXXITHE MASTHEADXXIITHE QUARTER-DECKXXIIIMOBY DICKXXIVHARK!XXVTHE CHARTXXVITHE MAT-MAKERXXVIITHE FIRST LOWERINGXXVIIIAHAB\u2019S BOAT AND CREW.
