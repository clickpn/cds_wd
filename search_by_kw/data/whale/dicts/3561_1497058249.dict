VHubb's Beaked Whale Skull - The Hubb's beaked whale is found only in the northern Pacific Ocean. This species received its name from the first specimen described by Carl Hubbs in 1945. Like all beaked whales, the Hubb's beaked whale has a long rostrum or "beak". Most beaked whales possess only two teeth that only erupt in mature males of the species. Males use these teeth for fighting, which generally results in many scars, but rarely death.
