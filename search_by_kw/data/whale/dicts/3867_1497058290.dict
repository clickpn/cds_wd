VNorthern Right Whale Dolphin Skull - The Northern right whale dolphin ranges in the Northern Pacific ocean. This species inhabits deep, offshore waters and is seldom seen near the shore. The right whale dolphin is named due to it lacking a dorsal fin, the same as the right whale. This species feeds on deep-water fish such as squid and lanternfish.
