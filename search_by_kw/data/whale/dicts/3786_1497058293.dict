VMelon-headed Whale Skull - The melon-headed whale is found throughout tropical seas, but is poorly known to science. This species feeds on pelagic fish, squid and crustaceans. Melon-headed whales are gregarious and swim in pods that sometimes number as many as 100 individuals. Although the original taxonomist wrongly named this species (the literal translation of Peponocephala means "pumpkin-headed") the name has been accepted by most scientist.
