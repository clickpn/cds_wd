VThe order Cetacea is made up of the Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises of the world. There are 79 species ranging from the tiny Finless Porpoise, measuring 1.2 meters and weighing 25kg, to the enormous Blue Whale, which may grow to lengths of up to 31 meters and weigh up to 190,000kg. Their bodies are distinct among other marine animals in that many have a torpedo-shaped torso tapering gracefully to a tail. The tail fins extend horizontally. Their sparsely-haired young and mammary glands confirm cetaceans as mammals.Dolphin skulls are streamlined. Their long snouts and seemingly endless rows of cone-shaped teeth allow for preying on Fish, Octopus, and Squid, the staples of their diet. The nasal pathways open to the top of the skull, an evolutionary plus for an animal with an exclusively aquatic lifestyle.
