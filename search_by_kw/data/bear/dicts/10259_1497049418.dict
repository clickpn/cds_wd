VDetailsDescriptionThis is a great quality reproduction Polar Bear Claw. It is made from a cast resin material and contains no actual polar bear part(s). The overall length of the claw is 3" following the outside curve from the base to the tip.- Great for decor, crafts or other projects.- Perfect for the mantle, table, counter top, shelf, ledge, etc...About the Polar Bear (Ursus)The polar bear roams the Arctic ice and it\u2019s surrounding coastal waters. They are very strong swimmers, and their large front paws (which they use to paddle) are slightly webbed. They depend on a thick coat of insulated fur, which covers a warming layer of fat. The bear's legendary white coat provides camouflage around the surrounding snow, yet under their fur, they have black skin which aids them in soaking up the sun\u2019s warm rays. Polar bear mothers typically have twins, who they raise until around the age of two, or until they can hunt for fish and seal on their own. SpecificationsDimensions:*Length: 3"
