The non-metallic bearing retainers minimize friction, thereby allowing these meters to be used with clean fluids that have poor lubricating properties ( i.e.water). Ball bearings also give the widest linear flow range, particularly in larger turbines. Bearing replacement and clean-up are fast and easy, since all internal parts are easily accessible by removing a single nut.These turbine flowmeters have a low mass rotor design which allows rapid dynamic response, so they can be used in pulsating flow applications. Deflector cones eliminate downstream thrust on the rotor and allow hydrodynamic positioning of the rotor between the cones. This provides wider rangeability and longer bearing life than conventional turbine flowmeters. Integral flow-straightening tubes minimize the effects of upstream turbulence.FTB-100 Turbine Meters are available with integral signal conditioners (as shown in photo) which provide scaled and unscaled frequencies, 4-20 mA, or 0-5 Volt outputs. Units without integral signal conditioners are supplied with mating connector for two-wire hook-up.SPECIFICATIONSModel No. FTB-106Fittings 1 MNPT Linear Flow Range Water LPM 15 to 227, GPM 4 to 60Max Operating Pressure 3850 psig Max Operating Pressure 5.1 psid Length mm (in)89 (3.5)NominalK-FactorPulses/Gal 640 Weight kg (lb) 0.9 (2)Accuracy: % of readingRepeatability: .1% of readingMaximum Temperature Range: -268 to 232(-450 to 450)Maximum Intermittent Overrange: 150% of maximum rangeMinimum Output Amplitude: 30 mV Peak-to-Peak Unscaled PulseMaterials of Construction: Body: 304 stainless steel; 1/2 NPT bodies contain Silver Solder. 3/4 NPT and larger are welded.
