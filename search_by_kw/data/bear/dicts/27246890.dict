VAaron Rodgers was a first round draft pick of the Green Bay Packers in the 2005 NFL Draft out of CAL after leading the Bears to a 10-1 record his junior season. Rodgers finally got the starting nod prior to the 2008 season and hasn't looked back since. Rodgers has led the Packers to the playoffs for two straight seasons (2009: 4.434 yards 30 TD a 7 INT 11-5 record) and arguably did his best work in 2010 putting the Packers on his shoulders and leading them into the SB. On February 6th 2011 Rodgers returned the Packers to glory leading them past the Pittsburgh Steelers in SB XLV. Aaron Rodgers is one of the best QB in the NFL today and should have the Pack competing for more SB titles for years to come. Rodgers has autographed this CAL Bears full size replica helmet and also wrote ""BEAT STANFORD"" CAL's #1 rival. You will receive the EXACT item shown. Autograph and inscription are authenticated by Fanatics and comes with their unique hologram # fixed to the item that is verified on their website.
