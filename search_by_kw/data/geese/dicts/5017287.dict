VThis is for a set of 6 Hitkari Potteries Christmas Geese Mugs. They are all in excellent condition, no chips, cracks or crazing. They appear to have never been used.On the bottom of each cup is inscribed with 2 Roses, Hitkari Potteries Bone China, and Made in India. The pattern is a Swirled design. On the front of each Mug is A Goose on a red background with white polka dots. The Geese has a holly on top of the head and a green and red ribbon around its neck. All six Christmas Mugs measure 4 inches tall and 3 inches in diameter at the top rim. The handle has a fancy C or D. This is great for the Holidays and also would display nicely in a Country Kitchen.
