VSolid brass Winged birds on curved brass rods. These rods have to be placed in certain positions for the birds to balance. The 9 inch spread wings of the geese actually can be moved slightly up and down. This stands approximately 12 inches high and would need an approximate 15 inch space from the back curved rod to the leading goose. There is a specific name for this type of mobile/stabile, but I can't recall at the moment. This is unsigned. Shows evidence of having a paper sticker on the bottom at some point. The picture with the arrows shows that one of the rods has been taken out of its place at some point and can be still taken off the base.You are purchasing this as is. There are no returns.
