VIt's A Small World 50th Anniversary Mystery Pin collection slider pin featuring geese from the Netherlands section. Sold exclusively at The Disneyland Resort. Total of 16 pins in the set, eight chasers and eight limited release pins. This is a chaser pin. The slider element is the geese which move back and forth. Measures 1.5" in each direction. Released May 26, 2016; a Limited Edition of 250. New, unused and mint condition. I am always happy to combine multiple items in one package to save on postage costs.
