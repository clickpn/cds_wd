Ivory carved by Indigenous Alaskan natives is legal to sell in the United States. Non-indigenous carved Walrus Ivory has a different set of laws, and needs to have been legally acquired before 1972 to be re-sold (see the Marine Mammal Act of 1972).About the Walrus (Ivory) (Odobenus rosmarus)The walrus is a large marine mammal found throughout the North Pole in the Arctic Ocean and subarctic seas of the Northern Hemisphere. Adult walruses are distinguished by their prominent tusks, flippers, and unique body shape. Adult males in the Pacific can weigh up to 4500 pounds. Walruses are most often found in shallow water above the continental shelves, spending most of their lives on the sea ice looking for mollusks to eat. Walruses are relatively long-lived, social animals, and they are considered to be a "keystone species" in the Arctic marine regions. The walrus has played a prominent role in the cultures of many indigenous Arctic peoples, who have hunted the walrus for its meat, fat, skin, tusks, and bone. Products made by natives such as the one in this listing help many indigenous artists make their living.SpecificationsDimensions:*Depth: 7/8"Height: 1 4/8"Width: 5/8"Weight: < 1 lbs
