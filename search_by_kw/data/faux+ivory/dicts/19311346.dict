VUberLiciousArt.com    Vintage Faux  Ivory Hand Carved Jewelry Element Antique This is a lovely hand carved jewelry ornament!It is an ornately carved design with the name "Helen" in the center..There are 2 holes for beading it on a bracelet or choker necklace. I am not an expert. I have no way of testing this broach toknow it\u2019s exact composition. I can only say it is vintage, not sure how old, but has beenwell taken care ofstored in a jewelry box for a long time. I bought it from anestate with other vintage jewelry. Most of it was better quality and vintage& antique pieces dating to the 1800\u2019s.It could be one of the following or possibly other that Icannot say here.Vegetable Ivory Bone -It is for you to decide. I am confident that it is not plastic.If it is important to you as to the exact composition of thispiece then you may not want to purchase it as we make no guarantees as to whatit is. And we do not take returns. This piece has a lot more clarity on the backside that may be interpretedas a way to determine more about this kind of piece.I think the buyer will know for themselves if this is whatthey desire. Measures aprox 1 11/16\u201d x 1.25\u201dI have another piece listed that is ornately hand carved and is 2 stags.It really isquite lovely as well!
