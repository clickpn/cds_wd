Their habitat consists of open prairies and fields containing long grasses and small shrubs. Adults of both sexes are medium sized, stocky, with round-wings. Both Male and Female birds have short tails which are often rounded and darker in color at the tip. Adult males have a distinctive set of orange feathers over their eyes and dark, long head feathers that can be raised or laid back along neck.
