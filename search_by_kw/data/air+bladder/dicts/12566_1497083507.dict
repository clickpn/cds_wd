Gambel's quails have grey plumage on most of their bodies, while the males have a copper crown on the top of their heads. Both male and female Gambel's quails can be identified by the curving plume made up of six black feathers, which droop forward over the front of the bird's head.About the Desert Sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni)The Desert Bighorn Sheep is a subspecies of Bighorn sheep that has adapted to a much warmer and arid climate. This climate offers very little water or food, making survival very difficult. Their range includes much of the southwestern United States into the northern mountains of Mexico. The Desert Bighorn sheep is smaller than the Rocky Mountain bighorn, with a smaller skull, bigger ears, paler color and a shorter coat with males generally weighing approximately 150-170 lbs and females often weighing 90 - 120 lbs. Their habitat includes desert mountains with ample sources of water, as they must drink every few days during extremely hot weather to survive.
