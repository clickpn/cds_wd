Their habitat consists of open prairies and fields containing long grasses and small shrubs. Adults of both sexes are medium sized, stocky, with round-wings. Both Male and Female birds have short tails which are often rounded and darker in color at the tip. Adult males have a distinctive set of orange feathers over their eyes and dark, long head feathers that can be raised or laid back along neck. They also possess a circular, un-feathered neck patch can be inflated while displaying, this like their comb feathers is also orange. Adult female Prairie Chickens have shorter head feathers and lack the male's orange comb and neck feathers, allowing them to stay better camouflaged when protecting their young.
