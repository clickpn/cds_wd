VNOTE: Photo #1 shows a much accurate color of this ring. The color of my photos varied due to indoor lighting.Carved ring made of animal bone, most likely ox/cow bone. Please let me know if you think otherwise, before buying. This is not ivory, jade, or plastic.Obvious discolorations, bone pores, lining, residue, and metal rusts. The color varies, from faint yellow-white to an oil-like color. Some surface nicks, tiny chips, and wears. There is a hairline crack on the ring band, but has a secure old metal strip as reinforcement. I think there are two holes, to hold the ends of the metal strip. Obvious amount of pores at the underside and on the lower (or outer rim).The carving resembles a beetle, but I don't know what kind of insect. Circa: 20th century.The ring band is oval shaped, not circular.Length: 3.5cmBand width: 1.4cmBand length: 1.8cm
