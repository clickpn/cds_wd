VPlease note that this is an art glass panel rather than a stained glass panel. Art glass and stained glass do differ. Art glass panels are lighter and and the glass is thinner than in stained glass panels. Stained glass panels consist of individual pieces of stained glass soldered together to form a pattern. Art glass panels are created by placing thin lead strands on a sheet of solid glass to define the pattern and then hand-painting. Heat is then applied to bond the lead and paint to the glass.Hummingbird & Blue Columbine "Welcome"Vertical Hand Painted Art Glass Panel8.5" wide x 38.5" highFREE SHIPPINGThere are three frame finishes available (see photo)...medium oak, whitewash or barn board.
