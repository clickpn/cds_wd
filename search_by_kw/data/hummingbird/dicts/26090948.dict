VThe thing I"ve always disliked about garden stakes is that so many times they LOOK big in the pictures.....and then you GET them and they turn out to be so SMALL .   THIS piece doesn't have that problem.  You will be THRILLED with how nice and Big the hummingbird is.  It is LITERALLY a piece of ART.The body is made of THICK...HEAVY....blown glass in a multi-colored swirl pattern.  It's been blown into a heavy iron frame (they call this process "caged glass").  It's hard to capture just how nice this piece is in pictures.  The hummingbird ALONE weighs FIVE & a Half POUNDS.The iron stake is approximately 22-23 inches.  The hummingbird measures approx. 20" long (front to back), 11 5/8" wide side to side at the wings and 17" tall (standing top of wings to bottom of tail).NO two pieces are EVER exactly alike either.  That's why we take individual pictures of EVERY piece we sell.  The custom blown hummingbird you SEE in the pictures is the EXACT one you can expect to RECEIVE.You won't see a garden stake like THIS at your friends houses!
