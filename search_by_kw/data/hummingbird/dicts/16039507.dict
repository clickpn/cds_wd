VPlease note that this is an art glass panel rather than a stained glass panel. Art glass and stained glass do differ. Art glass panels are lighter and and the glass is thinner than in stained glass panels. Stained glass panels consist of individual pieces of stained glass soldered together to form a pattern. Art glass panels are created by placing thin lead strands on a sheet of solid glass to define the pattern and then hand-painting. Heat is then applied to bond the lead and paint to the glass.Hummingbirds & FuchsiaHorizontal Hand Painted Art Glass Panel35.5" wide x 9" highFREE SHIPPINGThe horizontal format of this impressive piece, featuring vibrantly colored hummingbirds and fuchsia blossoms, brings dramatic impact to transoms and picture windows!This horizontal panel is zinc-framed and measures 35.5" wide x 9" high.
