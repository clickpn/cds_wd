V.Offered for your collecting enjoyment is this incredibley beautiful majolica ceramic art pottery sugar and creamer.It is not marked but it makes me think of Fitz and Floyd in quality and extreme beauty.Both pieces features a blue, orange and black humming bird going after the nectar of the pink hybiscus flowers and green leaves. For the sugar bowl the top is a hybiscus flower bud with green leaves and it has a spoon with a hybiscus flower bud as the tip of the spoon.These seems to have been used only for decoration purposes!The creamer measures 4 inches tall and 5.5 inches wide from spout to handle. The sugar bowl measures 4 inches wide and 5 inces tall.They are in excellent condition with only a small chip on the underside of the sugar bowl lid that is not seen from the top. This will be well wrapped so the extended wing of each hummingbird does not break!Add this to your vintage majolica collection today!! Also see the matching tea pot and cookie jar!fm738
