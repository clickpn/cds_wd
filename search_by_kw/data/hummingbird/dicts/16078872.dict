VPlease note that this is an art glass panel rather than a stained glass panel. Art glass and stained glass do differ. Art glass panels are lighter and and the glass is thinner than in stained glass panels. Stained glass panels consist of individual pieces of stained glass soldered together to form a pattern. Art glass panels are created by placing thin lead strands on a sheet of solid glass to define the pattern and then hand-painting. Heat is then applied to bond the lead and paint to the glass.Hummingbirds & FuchsiaLarge Window Treatment Package1 Panel:  20.5" wide x 42" high 2 Panels:  10.25" wide x 42" high 4 Hanging Chain KitsFREE SHIPPINGA dramatic and stunning presentation in a large window with the larger panel flanked by the two narrower panels.
