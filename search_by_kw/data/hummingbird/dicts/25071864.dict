Vcomes in new sealed gibson factory box, all new, just old stock.OVERVIEWA Gibson classic in a gorgeous Heritage Cherry finish and enhanced with L.R. Baggs electronics.From a company that has brought the guitar world so many great originals, the Hummingbird stands out strong and proud. Introduced in 1960 as Gibson\u2019s first square-shouldered dreadnought, the Hummingbird arrived at the dawn of a new era in music, and was rapidly embraced by several prime movers on the scene. In the hands of everyone from Keith Richards to Gram Parsons, it quickly proved itself equally adept at folk, country and rock, and excelled at many of the crossovers genres in between that helped to set the scene for the \u201960s.Much of the Hummingbird\u2019s appeal lies in its versatility. However you attack this flat-top, it pumps out rich, deep tones, and is equally at home thrumming out first-position chords as it is taking the spotlight for flatpicking leadlines further up the neck. Its spacious mahogany body and sweet, select Sitka spruce top are more than capable of nailing down the rhythm in the hands of a rock and roll sideman, or of accompanying the most nuanced performance under the fingers of today\u2019s alternative singer-songwriter.Made in the image of the original, in Gibson\u2019s acclaimed acoustic facility in Bozeman, MT, today\u2019s Hummingbird lives up to its pedigree, bringing you all of these capabilities and more as, quite simply, one of the finest acoustic guitars available today. This particular model includes the minimalistic L.R. Baggs VTC pickup for accurate plugged-in tone and a special Heritage Cherry finish.Included hardshell case.FEATURES Body    Body type: Square shoulder    Cutaway: Non-cutaway    Top wood: Solid Sitka    Back & sides: Mahogany    Bracing pattern: Scalloped Top Bracing    Body finish: Nitrocellulose Lacquer    Orientation: Right handedNeck    Neck shape: Slim taper    Nut width: 1.725" (43.8mm)    Fingerboard: Rosewood    Neck wood: Mahogany    Scale length: 25.5"    Number of frets: 20    Neck finish: Nitrocellulose LacquerElectronics    Pickup/preamp: Yes    Brand: L.R.
