VBald Eagle Skull - The bald eagle ranges throughout most of North America. This large species is primarily feeds on fish but will also prey on smaller birds and scavenge. Due to its diet, the bald eagle spends much of its time near lakes, rivers, and the coast. Once threatened with extinction due to water pollution from the now banned chemical pesticide DDT, the bald eagle is now recovering in much of its range.
