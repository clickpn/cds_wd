VThe golden eagle, originally native to much of Eurasia and North America, has been extirpated from much of its former eastern North American range and is now found primarily in mountainous areas of the west. This large species, reaching a wingspan of seven feet, primarily feeds on rabbits, large rodents, carrion and small livestock. Golden eagles nest on cliffs where they lay one to four eggs.
