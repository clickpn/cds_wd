VOffered for your collection is this very unusual majolica polar bear.I found this in the east of France not far from the German border. I think it is German as it has the Eagle with an M in the makers mark. He does not have the name of his country of origin so this leads me to believe he is very old.This polar bear might have been a Schnapps bottle at one time, he has a cork inside.He is sitting up with his front paws crossed.He is in excellent condition with no chips or cracks! He does have overall glaze crazing attesting to his great age.He measures 8 inches tall.Add this wonderful Polar Bear to your collection today or give as a fabulous antique gift!!Please see all of our Figurines in our store!
