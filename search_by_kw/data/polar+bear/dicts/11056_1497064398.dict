They are surprisingly strong, agile swimmers, and their large, slightly webbed front paws to paddle and navigate the frigid waters. Polar Bear depend on a thick coat of insulated fur, which covers a warming layer of fat. Their unmistakeable white coat provides camouflage around the surrounding snow, yet under their fur, they have black skin which aids them in soaking up the sun\u2019s warm rays. Polar bear mothers typically have twins, who they raise until around the age of two, or until they can hunt for fish and seal on their own.
