VThis is a beautifully crafted Custom Made Damascus Steel Straight Razor w/ Camel Bone & Wood Handle. Damascus for this razor was created by forge welding multiple layers of steels into a Solid block called a billet (15N20 &1095 High Carbon Tool Steels). The billet is folded and re-welded several times to produce several layers. Patterns are created by manipulating the steel during the forge welding process. When acid is added to the blade, it attacks the layers of hard and soft steels differently, highlighting the attractive layered pattern in the Steel.The combination of layered hard and soft steel creates blade flexibility, toughness and produces invisible serrations on the blade that aid cutting. The hardness of the Damascus steel is 55-60 HRC on Rockwell scale. The handle is made out of Camel Bone & Wood, with silver pins spanning the blade. The inside of the handle is lined with brass. The spine of the razor is beautifully file worked. This razor comes with a genuine leather sheath. This razor is a must have! Specifications: Overall Length: 9.5\u2033 Blade Length: 4\u2033 Handle Length: 5.5\u2033 Camel Bone & Wood Handle Includes Genuine Leather Sheathwe do not ship to Alaska Hawaii Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands
