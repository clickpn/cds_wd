VThis is a beautifully crafted Custom Made Damascus Steel Hunting Knife w/ Giraffe Bone Handle, Damascus Bolster, Leather Spacers. Damascus for this knife was created by forge welding multiple layers of steels into a Solid block called a billet (15N20 &1095 High Carbon Tool Steels). The billet is folded and re-welded several times to produce several layers. Patterns are created by manipulating the steel during the forge welding process. When acid is added to the blade, it attacks the layers of hard and soft steels differently, highlighting the attractive layered pattern in the Steel.The combination of layered hard and soft steel creates blade flexibility, toughness and produces invisible serrations on the blade that aid cutting. The hardness of the Damascus steel is 55-60 HRC on Rockwell scale. The handle is full tang, made of Giraffe Bone & Camel Bone Handle Damascus Bolster and Leather Spacers. There are also brass pins spanning the handle. This knife comes with a genuine leather sheath, with a belt loop on one end. This knife is a must have for any hunter or outdoors-man! Specifications: Overall Length: 13 inch Blade Length: 8 inch Handle Length: 5 inch, Damascus Steel Guard, Brass & Leather Spacers Includes Genuine Leather Sheathwe do not ship to Alaska Hawaii Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands
