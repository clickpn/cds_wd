VAnkole-Watusi is a breed of cattle originally native to Africa. It has very large, distinctive horns, which can grow up to 6 feet long. The animals' very large horns are honeycombed with blood vessels, and are used to thermo-regulate in hot temperatures. Blood moving through the horns is cooled by moving air, and then flows back into the body and lowers the animal's body temperature.Product Type: Skull onlyNotes:Natural damage around the left orbital bonePlease see photos for details and call with any questions.
