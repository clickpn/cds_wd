VShark teeth are embedded in the gums of the animal rather than directly to the jaw. Sharks are constantly loosing teeth due to ware and tare when they eat, though the teeth are replaced throughout the animals' life. Multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove on the inside of the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt. Some sharks may lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime. The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. In most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row.These shark jaws vary in size from 5  to 19 inches. Jaw configuration, shape and size will vary from those pictured.
