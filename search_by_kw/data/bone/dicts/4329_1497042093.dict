VWolverine Skull - The wolverine is the second largest living member of the Mustelidae family. They are aggressive and extremely strong predators. Their large pads and claws allow them to run down prey in deep snow. Wolverines are fast reaching speeds of up to 30 miles per hour. Wolverines range from North America through Siberia. Due to over trapping and hunting, wolverine numbers have drastically decreased in the US and Canada.
