VDuck-billed Platypus Skull - This egg-laying Monotreme possess a duck-like bill, webbed feet and a large flattened tail. Native to Australia, this aquatic mammal eats a variety of small animals including crayfish, earth worms, frogs, and small fish. The platypus has a pair of venom producing spurs on its hind legs that serve as protection. These spurs can cause agonizing pain to humans and have been reported to kill dogs.
