VThe Blue and Gold Macaw is a large South American parrot. As its name suggests, this animal has beautiful blue and yellow coloration that makes this bird easily recognized. It is a member of the large group of Neotropical parrots known as macaws. It inhabits forest tropical rainforests where the animal feeds on fruits and nuts. This one-of-a-kind blue and gold macaw skeleton has been previously articulated. Therefor, many of the bones have been hollowed to allow wire to run through them. Some bones exhibit damage that could be easily repaired. Please see photos for detail.
