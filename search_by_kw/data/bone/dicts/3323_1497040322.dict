VFalse Killer Whale Skull - The false killer whale received its name from its similarity in appearance to the "true" killer whale, the orca. False killer whales are found throughout many of the worlds warm and temperate oceans. This species was only known from fossil records and thought to be extinct until 1861 when a pod stranded in Germany. This gregarious species typically swims in pods of 10 to 20 individuals.
