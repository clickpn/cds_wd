VThe common eland is considered one of the largest species of antelope, it can be found in most of East and Southern Africa. One interesting fact about the common eland is that this is the slowest species of antelope, with a peak speed of about 25mph which tires them quickly. This unique eland exhibits a nice set of horns, though the skull exhibits extensive damage. The nasal bones are missing in addition to the pre-maxilary bones.Please see photos for details.Call with any questions.
