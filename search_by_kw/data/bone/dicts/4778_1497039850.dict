VThis set includes four animal bone pathology specimens as well as four non-pathological specimens for comparison. This eight piece set includes the following specimens:Broken and healed baboon femur Unbroken baboon femur Broken and healed coyote fibula/tibia Unbroken coyote fibula/tibia Diseased goat metatarsal Image Un-diseased goat metatarsal Deer mandible half with Actinomycosis (lumpy jaw) Deer mandible half without ActinomycosisBaboon, Papio sp., FemurThe pathology to this specimen is believed to have been caused by a gunshot wound, shattering the diaphysis. Premortum, the wound had substantially healed since the time of injury, but would have obviously caused this animal great pain and discomfort. Flexing of the leg muscles (biceps femoris and semimembranosus) during the healing of the femur has caused the two shaft portions to overlap, thus fusing incorrectly and shortening the leg by 2.75\u201d (6.9cm). This crippling injury would most likely have caused the partial or complete loss of use of this limb.Coyote, Canis latrans, Tibia/FibulaThe wound to this canid tibia and fibula was the result of trauma sustained by impact with a vehicle. Constriction of the surrounding muscles during the healing process has caused a severe deformation of the bones, including shortening of their total length by 1.5\u201d (3.8cm). This animal no longer had the use of this leg but was obviously able to survive for an extended length of time. Ironically, this specimen was collected along a roadway and, presumably, met his fate during a second vehicle collision.Goat, Capra hircus, MetatarsalThe pathology inflicting this specimen is believed to be the result of a severe bone infection or metabolic bone disease. This pathology has resulted in the pitting and splintering of the internal and external bone. This infection may have affected other systems in this specimen\u2019s body and possibly contributed to the animal\u2019s death.Deer, Odocoileus sp. MandibleThis specimen suffered from an affliction commonly called \u201clumpy jaw\u201d. This malady, more appropriately called Actinomycosis, is the result of an infection of the jaw when foreign bodies, often plant stems or twigs, become wedged in the gum line, thus allowing the bacteria Actinomyces sp. to penetrate the area. This occurs primarily in cud-chewing bovids and cervids. In livestock, this condition is treatable with antibiotics. In wild species Actinomycosis will cause the deterioration of the mandible, which can then spread.These original specimens reside in the Museum of Osteology collection.
