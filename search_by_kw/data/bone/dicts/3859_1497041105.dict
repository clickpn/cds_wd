VThe Nile Crocodile is native to the river systems of tropical and southern Africa. This large crocodilian can weigh up to 2000lbs (900kg) and grow to a length of 20 feet (6m). This large carnivore preys on mammals when they come to drink, submerging at the waters edge and attacking in ambush. Smaller crocodiles will also feed on fish, birds and other reptiles.
