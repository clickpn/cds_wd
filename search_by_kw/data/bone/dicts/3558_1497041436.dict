VThis specimen is an invaluable piece when exploring the field of forensic osteology. Specimen was cast from an actual human rib that held a lodged bullet. This wound, however, did not lead to the host\u2019s death, which can be evidenced by the healing of the rib around the bullet. This cast is a very interesting, and attention-holding specimen for the classroom.
