VWildebeest Skull - The blue wildebeest, a gregarious (herd-dwelling) species, is one of the most abundant of the African bovids. During dry seasons, wildebeest will make long migrations with individuals numbering into the hundreds of thousands. Both males and female wildebeest possess horns for defense. The wildebeest is sometimes also called a gnu.
