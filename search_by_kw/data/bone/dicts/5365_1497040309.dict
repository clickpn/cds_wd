VChimpanzee Skull - The chimpanzee is native to the rainforests of central and western Africa. Chimpanzees live in social communities that can number from 20 to 100 individuals. Chimpanzees are omnivores, dining on a variety of fruits, plants and insects. They will occasionally eat small vertebrates as well. Chimpanzees are the closest living relatives to humans, a fact confirmed by DNA testing.This original specimen resides in the Museum of Osteology collection.
