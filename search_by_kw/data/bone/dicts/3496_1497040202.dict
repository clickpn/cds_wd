VHarpy Eagle Skull - The harpy eagle is native to the rainforests of Mexico, Central America and South America. This large bird of prey is one of the dominant predators of the upper canopy. The harpy eagle feeds on monkeys, sloth and snakes, stealthily attacking its prey from above. This species is one of the largest of the eagles weighing up to 20 lbs. with a wing span up to 7 feet. Now listed as endangered, harpy eagle populations are declining due to forest fragmentation and sport hunting.
