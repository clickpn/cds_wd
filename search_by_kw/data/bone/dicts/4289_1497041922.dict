VVole Skull - There are 143 species of voles found world wide. Voles are small mouse-like rodents that occupy nearly all habitat types. Most voles can be distinguished from mice by their short tails and robust body. The vole is a favorite food source for many predators such as owls and fox. Voles belong to the family Muridae and the subfamily Arvicolinae, which also includes lemmings.
