VThe lumbar region is sometimes referred to as the lower spine, or as an area of the back. The lumbar is the vertebra that attaches to the sacrum.These human vertebra pieces are old and exhibit lesser bone quality. These bones may have cracks, chips, or small holes drilled in them for the purpose of being apart of a human skeleton at one time. Please see photos for details.
