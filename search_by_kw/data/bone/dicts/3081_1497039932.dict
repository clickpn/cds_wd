VThis bonobo skeleton, cast from a real specimen held at the San Diego Natural History Museum, was meticulously molded, cast in the finest resin, finished and then expertly mounted. Sometimes called the pygmy chimp, the bonobo is smaller, has more webbing between its toes and less sexual dimorphism than the common chimp. Humans, chimps, and bonobos share a common ancestry, with humans splitting off around 6 million years ago. Bonobos and chimps evolutionally diverged around 3 million years ago. Custom mounting is available, please inquire.
