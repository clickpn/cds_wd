VOld Ivory/Bone Turned Wax Seal, with mother of pearl intaglio. The seal contains several Chinese characters loosely translated as "United States First Squadron East Indies". Some age discolorations. There is a nick on the handle. The handled can be unscrewed into three parts; the end piece holding the intaglio may have some sanding marks on the four edges. They reveal a much "whiter" surface. Some grain lines on some areas on the handle.Original box marked with "Luenchun" mark. There is also a dried red wax inside showing what the seal looks like.The Mother-of-Pearl intaglio was previously loosened, and I re-attached the intaglio with some "Elmer" glue; buyer can easily remove the intaglio and re-glue it.The box is fragile and in poor condition. The top flap is starting to loosen or break off.Circa: 19th century, China.Luenchun box (size): 97mm x 40mm x 33mmWax Seal (length): 78mm
