VNorthern Fur Seal Skull - The northern fur seal ranges in the Pacific ocean from California to southern Alaska. Fur seals have thick pelage that aids to insulate this cold water species. This species is mostly solitary while at sea but congregates in groups numbering over a million during breeding seasons. This gregarious nature has allowed humans to commercially harvest fur seals for hundreds of years which lead to a decline in their populations. Now protected, fur seals populations are once again stable.
