VThe calcium in the bones have been stained with Alizarin Red, and the hyaline cartilage with Alcian Blue, allowing you to see the ends of the bones, trachea, and larynx. Afterwards, the specimens were cleared in potassium hydroxide solutions and placed into 100% Glycerine. These products provide a wonderful opportunity to study the visible bone growth and placement for each specimen.
