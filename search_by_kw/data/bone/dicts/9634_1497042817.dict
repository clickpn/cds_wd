VOstriches are the world's largest birds. They are primarily vegetation, occasionally feeding on locusts and remains left behind by predators. Ostriches are territorial and males may fight to defend harems of 3 to 5 hens. Contrary to popular belief ostriches do not bury their heads in the sand, they however, may lie on the ground with their necks stretched out when frightened.These feathers are on wonderful condition and show no damage. Please see photos for details.
