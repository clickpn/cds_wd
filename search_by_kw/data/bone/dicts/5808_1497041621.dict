VLowland Gorilla Skull - There are two sub-species of lowland gorilla; western and eastern, both of which inhabit isolated rainforest pockets where they forage for vegetation. Gorillas are highly social, forming small groups usually lead by a dominant male. The largest of the great apes, the gorilla weighs 300 - 400 lbs and can stand nearly 6 feet tall. Due to over-hunting and severe loss of habitat, the gorilla is listed as an endangered species.This Male Gorilla skull measures 12 inches long, 7 inches wide and 9 inches tall.This original specimen resides in the Museum of Osteology collection.
