Additional contaminants that bonechar carbon is recommended for are not certified by WQA or state standards. Contaminates addressed by bonechar may not be in your water.The use of bone charcoal or bone char is reported to be an effective means for the reduction of fluoride. Bone charcoal contains a carbon structure while supporting a porous hydroxyapatite matrix (a calcium phosphate hydroxide in crystalline form which is rich in surface ions which can be readily replaced by fluoride ion). Adsorption and ion exchange are thought to be the mechanism for fluoride reduction by bone char.The carbon media also works like regular carbon does.A whole-house filter system treats all water traveling to any faucet or fixture in the home. It removes the chemical before it can be ingested, breathed in, or absorbed by the skin during washing or bathing. A larger carbon filter like this one provides better filtration because of the amount of carbon,and depth of the filter bed. It does not cause a water pressure drop in your home compared to solid block carbon filter installed at the point of entry. Carbon removes/reduces many volatile organic chemicals (VOC), pesticides and herbicides, as well as chlorine, benzene, trihalomethane (THM) compounds, radon, solvents and hundreds of other man-made chemicals found in tap water.Carbon is a substance that has a long history of being used to absorb impurities and is perhaps the most powerful absorbent known to man. One pound of carbon contains a surface area of roughly 125 acres and can absorb literally thousands of different chemicals. Activated carbon which has a slight electro-positive charge added to it, making it even more attractive to chemicals and impurities. This filter contains 1 cu ft of media.This system is easy to set up. With this system you will receive:1 - 13"X65" FRP vessel. (Color Varies)1 - Manual Backwash Valve3 - cubic ft Bone Char CarbonManual ValveThis is the Manual valve. It has very few moving parts, and easy to use. When you need to backwash a filter, you put it into the backwash cycle for 10 minutes, followed by a rinse for 3 minutes, and then back into the service mode. That is all there is to it! Once a week schedule for backwashing is generally sufficient. For a more economical product, and ease of use, we recommend you get this rather than opting for a unit that does not backwash, read the section on the benefits of backwashing above.Please visit our store for more choices on quality water filters and reverse osmosis systems.Payment:PAYPAL preferred.Shipping:Shipping Details: Please pay with PayPal for fastest delivery.
