VAustralopithecus robustus , discovered in South Africa in 1938, is considered by many to be a subspecies of A. boisei. There is also debate concerning the genus of this species and it is often referred to as Paranthropus robustus. To date, the most complete robustus specimen found, SK 48, is believed to be a female specimen.
