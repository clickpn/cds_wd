VAn examination of this skull suggests an age of 3 ½ to 4 ½ years. The skull of this young child shows, in perfect detail, an entire set of deciduous (juvenile) dentition in both the upper and lower jaws. It serves as an excellent educational tool and reference specimen for the evaluation of deciduous dentition and evaluation of a sub-adult skull for the purposes of age determination. Furthermore, osteologists can appreciate the "open" nature of the sutures, including the basilar (spheno-occipital synchondrosis) suture, a sign of skeletal immaturity. The skull originated from a 1970's medical school collection of human skeletal remains from India.
