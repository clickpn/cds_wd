VSperm Whale Tooth - The average sperm whale can weigh as much as 50 tons, grow to a length of 65 feet, and live for 30 years. Sperm Whales travel in schools of about 20 individuals. This species eats squid and various deep-water fish such as barracuda. This replica is an example of one of the 16 to 30 conical teeth that line either side of the sperm whale's lower jaw. The upper jaw has only vestiges of teeth that are non-functioning.
