VThe brown kiwi is found in the coniferous forests of northern New Zealand. This nocturnal, flightless bird has feathers that more closely resemble hair. Being omnivorous, kiwis feed on a varied diet of small invertebrates, insects, fruits and berries. Its long beak can be used to sniff out and probe for its prey. The name kiwi comes from the call of the male. Female kiwi's lay large eggs that comprise as much as 20% of their body weight.Specimen pictured with egg and on stand.
