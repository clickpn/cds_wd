VThe modern domestic duck originates from the wild mallard. Believed to have been domesticated as many as 8,000 years ago, the duck has long served as a stable food source for humans. The duck's beak, or bill, is designed for feeding on aquatic vegetation, macro-invertebrates, grains and the occasional vertebrate. This, coupled with its webbed feet, make the duck perfectly adapted to its aquatic habitat.These domestic duck skeletons exhibits no damage. The sclerotic eye rings are included. These skeletons would make a great articulation project for any collector. Please see photos for details and feel free to call with any questions.
