VThe eastern-spotted skunk is more weasel-like in body shape than the more familiar striped skunk. The eastern spotted skunk has four stripes on its back which are broken in pattern, giving it a "spotted" appearance. Skrjabingylus nasicola is a species of parasitic nematode. The life cycle includes an intermediary mollusc host and a paratenic host. Adult worms are very commonly found in the nasal sinuses of spotted skunks.Please see photos for details.Call with any questions.
