VAlthough the Peccary, also known as the Javelina (hav-ah-leen-ah), may appear somewhat pig-like externally, they actually belong to their own family, Tayassuidae. The name javelina is Spanish and comes from their long, sharp, javelin-like canines. Peccaries use these sharp tusks to fight off many predators. This specimen is from owner Jay Villemarette's private collection. It is being sold as-is with no further cleaning. The Skull has some damage to the mandible, the auditory bulla, and is missing teeth. Please see photos for details and call with any questions.
