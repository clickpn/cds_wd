VWhite Pelican Skull - The white pelican is native to a large region of central and coastal North America. This majestic bird is capable of long migration flights using its broad wings to soar gracefully on thermal updrafts. Pelicans are carnivores that feed on a variety of fish, using their long beaks and wide throat pouch to gulp up their prey. Pelicans can often be seen diving from great heights to capture fish and sometimes work in groups to capture prey.
