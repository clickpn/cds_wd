VWhite-handed Gibbon Skull - The white-handed gibbon is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. This species, like most gibbons, is monogamous. White-handed gibbons are primarily a fruit eater and rarely eat other plants material. To move quickly through the canopy treetops, gibbons use a form of locomotion called brachiating, which involves long swinging and grasping arm strides.
