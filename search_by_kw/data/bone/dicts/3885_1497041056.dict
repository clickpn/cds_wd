VBornean Orangutan Skull - Native to the island of Borneo, this great ape was recently split from the Sumatran orangutan and given individual species status. The Malay word "orangutan" means "old man of the forest". Orangutans have impressive canine teeth and the longest snout of the great apes. This species is sexually dimorphic, with males being nearly twice the size of females.
