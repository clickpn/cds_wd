VKNM ER 732 - Discovered in 1970 by Richard Leaky and H. Mutua at Koobi Fora in Kenya, this female Australopithecus boisei skull, designated KNM ER-732, dates back to 1.7 MYA. It differs from other A. boisei skull finds in that it lacks both the sagittal and nuchal crests common to the males of this species. It is also much smaller than the other A. boisei skulls, suggesting sexual differences in this species that are very similar to those found in modern day great apes.
