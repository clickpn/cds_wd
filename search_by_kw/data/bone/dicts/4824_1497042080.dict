VThe African crested porcupine is native to regions of Northern Africa , Southern Europe, and areas of the Mediterranean. This is a large species of porcupine, complete with a full compliment of defensive quills and has very few natural predators. African porcupines are herbivorous feeding on various plant parts including roots, bark, and fruit. The skull of this species, as well as its southern relative H. africaeaustralis, exhibits an inflated nasal region creating a unique identification characteristic.Almost the entire body is covered with bristles which are either dark brown or black and rather coarse. This mammal is recognizable by the quills that run along the head, nape, and back that can be raised into a crest. Hence the name crested porcupine.
