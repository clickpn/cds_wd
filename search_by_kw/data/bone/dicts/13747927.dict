Please remember that we do make honest mistakes as we test andinspect over 2000 items per month, so always communicate with us if there is a concern.The majority of our items are overstocks, customer returns, shelf pulls, floor models, etc. Bottom linemany have been opened, handled, and perhaps used by somebody. Most come in the original packageand are fully functional. Please read the item description carefully for any missing parts or defects.

If an item cannot be tested or is partially tested the detailswill be listed with the Item Actual Operation details. Jakemart will not be responsible or liable forproduct operation beyond what Jakemart has listed as tested. For example we may state the item powerson but no other testing has been performed.
