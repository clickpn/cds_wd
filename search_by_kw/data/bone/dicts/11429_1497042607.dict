VThe meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus), sometimes called the field mouse or meadow mouse, is a North American vole found across Canada, Alaska, and the northern United States. Its range extends farther south along the Atlantic coast. The meadow vole is active year-round, usually at night. It also digs underground burrows, where it stores food for the winter and females give birth to their young. Although these animals tend to live close together, they are aggressive towards one another. This is particularly evident in males during the breeding season.   Product Type: Study skin onlyNotes:     This specimen is from an old veterinary anatomist's private collection    Being sold as-is with no further cleaning    To view the rest of the collection, click herePlease see photos for details and call with any questions.
