VThe term "rat" applies to the larger members of the Muridae family, comprised of 1,138 species of rats, mice, hamsters, voles, lemmings, and gerbils. Rats, like all rodents, have ever growing incisors, and therefore, need to chew on wood or other materials to wear them down. This, along with their appreciation for human food and crops, and the propensity to spread disease, causes the rat to be one of humanity's worst pests. Various species of rats can be found throughout the world.The calcium in the bones have been stained with Alizarin Red, and the hyaline cartilage with Alcian Blue, allowing you to see the ends of the bones, trachea, and larynx. Afterwards, the specimens were cleared in potassium hydroxide solutions and placed into 100% Glycerine. These products provide a wonderful opportunity to study the visible bone growth and placement for each specimen.Please see photos for details.
