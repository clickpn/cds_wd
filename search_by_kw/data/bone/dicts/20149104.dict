VWHOLE HOUSE 1.5 CU FT BONE CHAR CARBON.  FLECK 5600 AUTOMATIC BACKWASH VALVE.Unlike standard coconut or charcoal based carbon filters which cannot filter fluoride, our Whole House Filter uses a unique calcium based BoneChar carbon designed to reduce the fluoride from your water.Removes/Reduces Fluoride, Hydrogen Sulfide (Sulfur), and chemicals and odors! High flowHigh Flow Control HeadComplete System with Bypass ValveAdditional Metals Addressed By BoneChar Carbon*Aluminum Arsenic III Arsenic V CadmiumChromium III Chromium IV Copper LeadMercury Nickle Silver ZincFluoride      *The information provided on this table is based on Additional testing results of removal efficiency for heavy metals with the use of Bonechar courtesy of Glasgow University, UK and manufacturers of BoneChar. Additional contaminants that bonechar carbon is recommended for are not certified by WQA or state standards. Contaminates addressed by bonechar may not be in your water.The use of bone charcoal or bone char is reported to be an effective means for the reduction of fluoride. Bone charcoal contains a carbon structure while supporting a porous hydroxyapatite matrix (a calcium phosphate hydroxide in crystalline form which is rich in surface ions which can be readily replaced by fluoride ion). Adsorption and ion exchange are thought to be the mechanism for fluoride reduction by bone char. The carbon media also works like regular carbon does. A whole-house filter system treats all water traveling to any faucet or fixture in the home. It removes the chemical before it can be ingested, breathed in, or absorbed by the skin during washing or bathing. A larger carbon filter like this one provides better filtration because of the amount of carbon,and depth of the filter bed. It does not cause a water pressure drop in your home compared to solid block carbon filter installed at the point of entry. Carbon removes/reduces many volatile organic chemicals (VOC), pesticides and herbicides, as well as chlorine, benzene, trihalomethane (THM) compounds, radon, solvents and hundreds of other man-made chemicals found in tap water.Carbon is a substance that has a long history of being used to absorb impurities and is perhaps the most powerful absorbent known to man. One pound of carbon contains a surface area of roughly 125 acres and can absorb literally thousands of different chemicals. Activated carbon which has a slight electro-positive charge added to it, making it even more attractive to chemicals and impurities. This filter contains 1 cu ft of carbon, or 40 lbs.This system is easy to set up. With this system you will receive:1 9x48" FRP vessel.
