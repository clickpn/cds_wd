VThe dromedary camel, originally native to northern Africa and the Middle East, has been introduced throughout the world with large feral populations in Australia. The Dromedary camel has a single large hump on its back that is used to store fat. Dromedary camels are specifically adapted to life in the desert with their large padded feet for walking in sand and their ability to go long periods without water.This camel skull is in perfect condition, and is a nice opportunity to add this species to your skull collection.Please see photos for details.Call with any questions.
