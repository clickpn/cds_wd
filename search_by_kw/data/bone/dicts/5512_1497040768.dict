VThe house finch like to nest 5-7 ft. up, nests are made in cavities, including openings in buildings, hanging plants, and other cup shaped outdoor decorations. In the wild, the house finch can lay 4-5 eggs in a season. The eggs are subelliptical and smooth in shape, with a slightly glossy pale blue color with sometimes a wreath of very fine scrawls around the larger end.
