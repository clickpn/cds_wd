VThis specimen was cast from a real bone male Sumatran orangutan. Sumatran orangutans are larger than their Bornean cousin. The Malay word "orangutan" means "forest person". Restricted to the lowland swamp forests in Borneo and a small part of Sumatra, there are only about 15,000 Borneo and 5,000 Sumatran Orangutans left alive in the wild. Custom mounting is available, please inquire.
