VThe rattlesnake has long been the subject of persecution. In actuality, this reptilian predator is a valuable part of the natural food chain. Using its heat-sensing facial pits to locate prey, the rattlesnake primarily feeds on small rodents. Unlike other constricting snakes, rattlesnakes use venom, delivered through large hollow fangs, to kill their prey. The rattlesnake can also use this venom for protection if a predator fails to heed its rattled warning.
