VTuatara Skull - Surviving representative of the ancient reptile order Rhynchocephalia. The tuatara is native only to a handful of islands off the coast of New Zealand. This very rare and endangered species resembles a lizard in appearance, but is physiologically unique among modern reptiles including a diapsid skull. The tuatara feeds on insects and small vertebrates.
