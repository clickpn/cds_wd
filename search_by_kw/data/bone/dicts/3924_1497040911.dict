VPeregrine Falcon Skull - This magnificent raptor, once near extinction due to the elimination of their favorite prey, the passenger pigeon, and the use of DDT, is now recovering throughout much of its former range. The peregrine is one of the fastest birds and can reach speeds of up to 180 mph when diving for prey. Peregrines feed primarily on smaller birds including ducks and have adaptated to feeding on the introduced European pigeon.
