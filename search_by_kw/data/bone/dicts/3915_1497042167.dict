VPeccary Skull - Although the Peccary, also known as the Javelina (hav-ah-leen-ah), may appear somewhat pig-like externally, they actually belong to their own family, Tayassuidae. The name javelina is Spanish and comes from their long, sharp, javelin-like canines. Peccaries use these sharp tusks to fight off many predators.
