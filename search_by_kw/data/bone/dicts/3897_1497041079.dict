VOsprey Skull - The osprey is a fish eating species spending much of its time near lakes, rivers and coasts. Osprey have a unique hunting method where they will hover above the water to locate prey, then plunge feet-first, snatching their dinner with powerful talons. The Osprey has a large range that includes most of North America, South America, Eurasia, Africa and regions of Australia. The osprey is also referred to as the "fish hawk" due to its diet.
