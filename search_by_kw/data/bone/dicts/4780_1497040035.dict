VAfrican Lion Skull - The African Lion, as its name suggests, is native to the plains of Africa. This large predator prefers grassy plains, savannas, and semi-deserts. Lions are carnivores feeding on a variety of animals ranging from small insects to large herbivores such as the giraffe. This species is known for its sociable lifestyle. Unlike most other great cats, African lions live in groups known as a "Pride".
