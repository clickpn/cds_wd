VThe schnauzer is a breed of dog that originated in Germany in the 16th century. The term comes from the German word for "mustache", because of the dog's distinctively bearded snout.This specimen would make a great addition to any collection, though it is missing the top incisors.Please photos for details.Feel free to call with any questions.
