VDomestic Equine Horse Skull - The domestic horse is the best known perissodactyl. Horses have been used by man for thousands of years for transportation and as beasts of burden. Horses are browsers feeding on grasses as well as other vegetation. Horses are thought to have been domesticated between 4000 to 6000 years ago from wild equids native to Asia.Our economy quality horse skulls are expected to have several missing teeth or damage to the skull. These economy skulls are less than perfect and normally are NOT suitable for equine dentistry.Please call with any questions.
