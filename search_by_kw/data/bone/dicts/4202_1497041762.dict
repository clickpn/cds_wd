VStriped Skunk Skull - The Striped Skunk is easily recognized by its characteristic warning colors and pattern. A member of the Mustelid family, the stripped skunk can emit a noxious spray when defending itself from danger. The skull is distinct from other carnivores in having only one molar on each side of the upper jaw and two on each side of the lower jaw.
