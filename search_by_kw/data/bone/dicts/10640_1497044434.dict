VThe American Bison, also known as the buffalo, once numbered in the millions across North America. The bison was nearly hunted to extinction during the late 1800s. Due to protective legislation in the early 1900's, wild herds made a strong comeback. Bison are now considered a domesticated species and are commercially breed as livestock throughout the US.This specimen exhibits a fracture to the left eye orbit. Please see photos for details and feel free to call with any questions.
