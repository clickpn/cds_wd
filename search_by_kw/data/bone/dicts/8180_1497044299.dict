VThe domestic dog is believed to be a direct descendant from modern wolves. Dogs have been breed as pets for thousands of years with the earliest known domestication taking place as long as 12,000 years ago. Today, dogs serve man in many ways: as guides, search and rescue, for hunting purposes, to sniff out drugs or other contraband and even to track criminals. There are over 400 recognized breeds ranging from Chihuahua as the smallest example to the Irish wolfhound as the largest.This beautiful doberman dog skull is an excellent example of the species. This skull exhibits beautiful bone quality, though it does show the beginning signs of periodontal disease. Because of this skulls uniqueness, this skull would make a perfect aid for a vet.Please see photos for details.Call with any questions.
