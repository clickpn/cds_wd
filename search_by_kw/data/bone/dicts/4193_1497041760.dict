VStraw-colored Fruit Bat Skull - The straw-colored fruit bat, named for the yellow to orange markings on its shoulders and back, is native to most of subsaharan Africa. Like many other species of fruit bats, the straw-colored is a gregarious species. Colonies are large and can range in size from 100,000 to 1,000,000. This species feeds primarily on fruits, sucking their juices and spitting out the pulp and seeds.
