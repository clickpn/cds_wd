VGreat White Shark Jaw - Despite the false reputation given this species by Hollywood, the great white shark is the largest predatory fish in the world reaching a length of up to 20 feet and weighing as much as 4,000 pounds. This species name refers to its white belly. The teeth in the upper jaw are sharp, serrated triangles, while those in the lower jaw are smaller and weakly serrated. This species feeds on marine mammals such as seals, sea lions and dolphins as well as other fish.
