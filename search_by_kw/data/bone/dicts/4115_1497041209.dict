VSiamang Gibbon Skull - The Siamang, native to Southeast Asia, is the largest of the gibbons with an arm length of 1.5 meters. Considered a lesser ape, gibbons are known for their remarkable gymnastic ability. Gibbons live an arboreal life, high above the forest floor. Their long arms have evolved to allow for a graceful, almost ballet-like movement as they swing from branch to branch. This specialized form of locomotion is referred to as Brachiating.This original specimen resides in the Museum of Osteology collection.
