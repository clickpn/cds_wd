The ancient teachers pay respects of Phor-poo-lersri as the highest teachers who have many benefits that teach to the students willingly. The highest teachers have built Phra lersri's picture of worshipping. And the latter period of time also go to worship "phra ersi" in order to make a merit.

Phorpoo lersri will bring that one prosperous, charming and selling, and also protect him out of the devils, dangerous as the glass for making everything as he wants and succeeds. The merit of worshipping Phorpoo lersri is for the one who worship will receive the protection, has a charming and great kindness, succeed in duty and responsibility and has a luck and money, be richer and richer.         {note}Powered by eCRATER .
