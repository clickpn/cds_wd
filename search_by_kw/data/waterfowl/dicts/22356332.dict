VHowdy Folks,Hope all is well.Up for your viewing pleasure is a Smith Crafted round wooden type tin or container. Stamped on the back of tin "Smith Crafted Chicago" Has pictures of ducks on the front. Small dent on the edge. Possible discoloring or a stain on the lid as well. Tape residue on the back. Small dimple on the back as well.The lid could be hung as a picture. Measures about 10 3/16" across the top and about 2" deep. Now since this is a used tin there will be some rust, scratches and scuffs and wear. The tin will need to be cleaned better all I did was to rinse off the Deming dirt and dust. Water spots and any new dust and dirt from Deming are free. Weighs about 15 ounces, so we are looking at 2.1 pounds to ship. Folks the canister has many different uses, me I would use it to hold my extra nails, bolts and misc. stuff in my shop, however the wife says no!
