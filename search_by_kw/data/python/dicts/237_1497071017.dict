VThe family Pythonidae, commonly known simply as pythons, are a group of 26 species of non-venomous snakes. Native to Africa, Asia and Australia, pythons are some of the largest snakes in the world including the reticulated python which can reach lengths exceeding 28 feet. In the United States, the Burmese python has been introduced in the Everglades National Park where it is considered an invasive species and a detriment to the native wildlife.
