VThe ball python is a python species found in Africa that is the smallest of the African pythons. This snake is one of the most popular in the pet trade, largely due to its docile temperament and availability of genetic color phases. The name "ball python" refers to the animal's tendency to curl into a ball when stressed or frightened.These python skulls are in fantastic condition and would make nice additions to any collection. Please see photos for details. Call with any questions.
