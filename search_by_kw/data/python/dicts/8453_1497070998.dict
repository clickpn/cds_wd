VPython Skull - This  python is a large species of snake reaching a length of 23 feet. The diet of the Burmese python consist of small mammals and birds which it ambushes, constricts and swallows whole. Native to southeast Asia, the Burmese python is now protected in the wild. However, captive breeding for the pet trade has kept this species in plentiful stock.
