VJackson's Skull - Known also as the Black-legged mongoose, this Viverrid is native to rainforest areas of Africa including Uganda and Kenya. This species feeds mainly on invertebrates including insects and crabs, but will also feed on small rodents and carrion. This species is considered by some to be a sub-species of Bdeogale nigripes.
