VScarce Coca Cola Harlem Globetrotters Goose Tatum advertising sign-1952. The sign is professionally framed(33" x 22") with reflective glass. Goose is 27" x 16" behinda double mat. There is a light crease approx 7" that runs across the top of "Coca"(see photo)--on the right side is approx 1" tear on edge--and two dents on edge(see photos)--there are three tiny white spots bottom half of bottle. The original owner of the sign was very possessive of his sign as he printed his name under "Globetrotter"--Joe Johnson Jr IV(see photo). As best we can tell the sign has darkened--although it may be the glass. The frame has 4 holes each on a corner from being screwed into wall. From the same barn find as the Johnny Unitas Crown Gold gas canvas banner.OurGoal and Mission   Our goal is to deliver to our customers a quality,sought after collectible product at a fair price which is accurately described and shipped properly and in a reasonable time.
