VGreat pair of vintage figurines. These were made by Andrea in Japan. They were hand painted. Each stands approximately 13.5" tall. One is of an old man with a pipe holding a shovel standing next to a bucket of flowers. The other figure is of an old lady holding a basket with a bird in one hand and a pitcher in the other. A goose is standing at her feet. These were found in a box at an estate. Most of our products are antique, vintage, or preloved items and as such might have imperfections.
