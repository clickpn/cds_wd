VOld Mexican Eagle Mark 3 Taxco Sterling Silver Zebra Cufflinks Marked NAR                                                                      Product Description:                          These measure approx. 3/4"  X 7/8", and are marked with the Old Eagle Mark No. 3, and 925, and TAXCO and have the initials NAR.    These are identical a pair previously listed on eCRATER that were credited to ANTONIO PINEDA, however I do not know for sure that these were made by him, as I cannot find any information on the initlas NAR!
