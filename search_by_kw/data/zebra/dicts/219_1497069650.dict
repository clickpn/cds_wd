VThe zebra shark is a species of carpet shark and the sole member of the family Stegostomatidae. Found throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific, Adult zebra sharks are distinctive in appearance, with five longitudinal ridges on a cylindrical body, a low caudal fin comprising nearly half the total length, and a pattern of dark spots on a pale background. Zebra sharks are nocturnal and feed on molluscs, crustaceans, small bony fishes, and sea snakes.
