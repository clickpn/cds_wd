VDetailsDescription of Taxidermy For SaleThis is a great half-size Zebra taxidermy rug. It features a very soft hide, and an incredibly well-preserved tail. The craftsmanship on the rug is outstanding, and includes a lovely felt bordering along the edges, earning our Nice Plus\u2122 overall quality rating.- If this item is placed on the floor, we recommend light foot traffic (no shoes!), as heavier foot traffic will likely damage or dirty the fur.- This item may be hung on the wall as well. Hangers not included. Nails or tacks are optional.About the African Zebra (Equus quagga burchellii)The Burchell\u2019s Zebra, also know as the plains zebra, is the most common and widespread of the species.
