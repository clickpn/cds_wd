VToo Close to Call (Jay Jessop Racing Thriller)Two casino owners from Las Vegas plot to acquire a group of British racecourses for their Supercasino scam - and nothing is going to get in their way, certainly not someone like racehorse owner Jay Jessop. Meanwhile, Jay's world is beset with problems, ranging from the purely domestic to more pressing ones. A Touch of VengeanceThree powerful men and a rich young South African woman set out to settle a long-standing grudge and take National Hunt Racing by storm. Each has different motives, but they combine to make a formidable team. Odds on DeathInternational intrigue, murder, kidnapping and huge gambles puzzle the police and the racing authorities as twists and turns follow the race for the Trainers Championship. The plot moves from the Far East to the US and from South Africa to Europe. A rich amateur rider and a wealthy and powerful Oriental businessman add to the heady mixture.
