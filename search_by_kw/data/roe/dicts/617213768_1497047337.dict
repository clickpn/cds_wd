VTommy Roe(Pickwick 3361)-"Dizzy"-Sealed LP. Tracks include-Dizzy,Jack And Jill,Hooray For Hazel,Jam Up,Sheila,Party Girl,Wild Thing,Heather Honey.Widely perceived as one of the archetypal bubblegum artists of the late '60s, Tommy Roe cut some pretty decent rockers along the way, especially early in his career -- many displaying some pretty prominent Buddy Holly roots. In fact, Roe's initial pop smash, 1962's chart-topping "Sheila," was quite reminiscent of Holly's "Peggy Sue," utilizing a very similar throbbing drumbeat and Roe's hiccuping vocal. The singer had previously cut the song for the smaller Judd label before remaking it in superior form for ABC-Paramount. The infectious "Everybody" -- another hot item the next year -- was waxed in Muscle Shoals at Rick Hall's Fame studios, normally an R&B-oriented; facility (it's not widely known that Roe wrote songs for the Tams, a raw-edged soul group from his Atlanta hometown). Once Roe veered off on his squeaky-clean bubblegum tangent, he stuck with it for the rest of the decade. His lighthearted "Sweet Pea" and "Hooray for Hazel" burned up the charts in 1966, and he was still at it three years later when he waxed his biggest hit, "Dizzy," and "Jam Up Jelly Tight." A piece of shrink wrap has been removed from the front cover and the Lp has been autographed there by Tommy Roe.........CONDITION OF RECORD IS STILL SEALED.CONDITION OF AUTOGRAPH IS EXCELLENT.BOTTOM OF COVER HAS SOME WEAR WHICH DOES NOT AFFECT AUTOGRAPH..............
