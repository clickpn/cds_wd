VOpen cage style ring with centered bird skull.This is a sized ring, size 8, but in my opinion will also fit size 7.5. It is not an adjustable ring, and the band is solid in the back.The front including the bird skull measures approx. 1.40" in height. The bird skull is actually from a pair of earrings that I have listed here on eCRATER, so the top of the bird skull will have a hole in it from where the earring ear wire was (the ear wire was removed before I attached the bird skull to the ring). You may be able to see the hole in the top of the bird skull in photo #2. That said, the hole will not really be noticible when people look straight down at the ring on your finger.Antique silver plated metal, lead and nickel free.Care instructions:I have been wearing my bird skull ring for 1 year and it still looks exactly the same and just as fab as the one you will receive.I wanted to give you some care instructions, so your ring too, will last for years to come.As mentioned above, this ring is "plated" jewelry, which means it is costume jewelry.Friendly tips: Plated rings will not discolor your finger unless you are allergic to plated jewelry, you sweat a lot, or wear it in water. If you are unsure if you are allergic to plated jewelry, I recommend that you brush clear nail polish on the inside of the band, and allow to dry before wearing. Also, the metal on the ring will not discolor, unless you wear it in water often, or sweat excessively. Please do not get this ring wet. The bird skull is glued on with a strong epoxy jewelry adhesive, but water could still loosen the glue under the bird skull if the ring gets wet. I will send you a reminder to read these care instructions when I send your ring.It is also a good idea to keep your ring in an airtight ziplock style baggie when not being worn. ALL metals tarnish in time. Sterling silver and other fine metals will also discolor in time from the elements. I keep all my jewelry in airtight ziplock baggies when not being worn. Follow the care instructions above and your bird skull ring will last for years to come.Will wrap well with bubble wrap and ship in a bubble envelope for a safe transit.
