V____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________                                  You are buying :SHARK RAY SPINE 925 SilverRINGMaterial :SHARK RAY SPINE and 925 SilverOrigin : South of Thailand Ship to world wide ( read our policy for shipping below)Ring Size : 9.5 USShark Spine Size : W0.5x H0.8xL1.5 ( inches)Very big oneLimited time Item , very rare , Hard to find item____________________________________________________________________SHARK RAY SPINEThe Shark Ray has a unique thorny ridge on the hide on its back resembling "mountain ridges" that is harvested and very collectable.SHARK RAY CLASPERSThe males possess retractable copulation organs, referred to as claspers, located near the pelvic fins. These prepelvic claspers are spoon-shaped and consist of frill-like lobes and a globular gland. There is also a thumb-shaped clasper located on the head used to secure the female during copulation. On the Shark Ray, these have the same type of "thorny or mountain ridge" texture as the "spine" (which is a ridge on the hide on its back) which is also highly collectible.SHARK RAYSharkShark ray is also known also the bowmouth guitarfish and bowmouth wedgefish and is a relative to skates and rays.THESE SHARKS ARE NOT CAUGHT FOR THEIR JAWS. All shark jaws are obtained from the legal fishing industry in the Philippines and off the coast of India in the Indian Ocean. These sharks are caught for their hides & meat. The jaws & teeth are sold as a collectible to recycle 100% of the shark.We do not support sport fishing, illegal taking of sharks, we don't even eat in restaurants that serve Shark Fin soup due to the cruel and wasteful nature of shark finning. We do not catch sharks ourselves.____________________________________________________________________________________________Payment Term:Iaccept ONLY PayPal for payment.
