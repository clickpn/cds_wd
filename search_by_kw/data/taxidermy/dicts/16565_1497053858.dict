They often make their dens in hollowed out trees or thick brushy fields. Martens are the only member of the mustelid family with semi-retractable claws. Retractable claws allow the Pine Marten to climb or run on top of tree branches, as well as run quickly on the ground. They are mainly active at starting at dusk and continuing throughout the evening hours. Pine Martens have sharp teeth for catching and eating small birds, animals, insects, frogs, etc... They also have been known to include berries, bird's eggs, meat, nuts and even honey in their diets.SpecificationsDimensions:*Depth: 7"Height: 10"Width: 25"Weight: 3 lbs
