VThe California condor, once near extinction, is now recovering due to captive breeding and release programs. Historically, this species was found throughout southwestern North America. Today, monitored populations occur in southern California, and portions of the grand canyon. This large bird has a wingspan reaching over 9 feet. Condors, like most vultures, are scavengers with a diet consisting almost exclusively of carrion.
