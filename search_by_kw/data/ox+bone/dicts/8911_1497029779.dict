VThe crab-eating monkey is native to southeast Asia as well as Indonesia and the Philippine islands. As in most old-world primates, the crab-eating monkey has the same tooth count as humans. This species is omnivorous, eating a variety of plant parts and, as its name suggests, crustaceans and other small invertebrates. This monkey is commonly eaten by humans.These crab-eating macaque skulls exhibit beautiful bone quality and dental stages in development. Please see photos for details.  Call with any questions.
