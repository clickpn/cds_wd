VSandbar Shark Jaw - Living up to its name, the sandbar shark prefers the sandy bottoms of temperate or tropical coastal waters worldwide. It typically swims at depths of 60-200', feeding on bony fishes, mollusks and crustaceans. A popular target of both commercial and recreational fishermen, the shark is about 6' long and weighs up to 200 lbs. Its most distinctive characteristic is its uncommonly tall first dorsal fin. With a rounded, short snout, it has saw-edged upper teeth.
