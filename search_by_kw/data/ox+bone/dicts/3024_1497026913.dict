VBarred Owl Skull - The Barred owl is a woodland species that feeds on small mammals, crayfish, amphibians, and occasionally birds. Its name comes from the barred striping pattern on its chest, which helps it to camouflage when perching. The barred owl's characteristic call, a series of hoots imitating the phrase, "who cooks for you, who cooks for you all?" can be heard day or night.
