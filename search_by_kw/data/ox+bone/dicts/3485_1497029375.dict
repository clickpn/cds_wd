VHamster Skull - The hamster has long been a pet store favorite. Hamsters are native to northern Eurasia. In the wild, the hamster's life is much like any other small rodent. Their diet consists of grains, plant parts, insects and the occasional small vertebrates. Hamsters live in burrows and are often solitary unless breeding or caring for young. The Hamster is sometimes trapped for its fur and is considered a serious pest in some areas of its range.
