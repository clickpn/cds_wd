VThe Malayan flying lemur, also called the Sunda flying lemur, is native to much of southeast Asia including Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. Despite its name, the flying lemur is not a true lemur nor does it actually fly. Instead, this gliding mammal belongs to a unique order called Dermoptera, containing only two species, The Malayan and the Philippine flying lemurs.This skull exhibits extensive damage to the skull.Please see photos for details.
