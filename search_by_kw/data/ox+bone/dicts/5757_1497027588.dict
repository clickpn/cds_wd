VA more complete skull than our BC-106 Chinese Sabertooth Cat, this Megantereon nihowanensis skull has both sabers. The stand S-CB-20, is available separately for an additional $45.00. Please see Related Products, below. Late Miocene to earliest Pleistocene, (6 - .9 mya) China. The genus Megantereon has a very long history in the fossil record. It is found throughout most of the world. About the size of a stout jaguar but with a longer neck, this dirk-tooth saber cat was most likely a formidable predator. Most authors agree that Megantereon was a direct ancestor of the infamous genus Smilodon. We are grateful to the Babiarz Institute of Paleontological Studies for the opportunity to cast this individual.
