VSabertooth Cat - Homotherium crenatidens. Age: Early to mid Pliocene, (3 million years ago). The genus Homotherium comprises a unique group of saber tooth cats. Besides having their front limbs longer than the rear, most have robust incisors accompanied by medium to short, coarsely serrated canines. They were most likely a pursuit predator, and the incisors may have been used in conjunction with the killing bite, unlike those found on the more familiar saber tooth cat, Smilodon. Although their range was extensive, known from North America, Eurasia, and Africa, their occurrence is somewhat limited, and usually with only fragmentary remains. Although this specimen experienced some lateral crushing during fossilization, its dentition is almost flawless and, with its matching lowers, presents a wonderful and scientifically accurate example of these unique sabertooth cats.
