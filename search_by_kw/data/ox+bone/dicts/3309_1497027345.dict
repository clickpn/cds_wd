VEnglish Bulldog Skull - The English bulldog was originally bred as a bull-baiting dog to aid in cattle herding as early as the 1600's. Over time, however, this breed has developed more of a "lazy" reputation being more sought as pets rather than work dogs. The skull of this breed is brachycephalic and has an extreme under bite.
