VNine-banded Armadillo Skull - The Nine Banded Armadillo is the only member of the order Xenarthra that is found as far North as North America. This nocturnal insectivore is known most for the armored shell it uses as protection. Once only found in the extreme southern United Sates, their range now extends north through much of the Midwest.
