VThe age of the skull was determined by referring to the natural bone specimen and a panoramic radiograph, both of which suggest a range from 7.5 to 12.5 years. The root apices of the permanent incisors and first molars are almost completely formed. The spheno-occipital synchondrosis is open. The anterior intra-occipital suture is closed.
