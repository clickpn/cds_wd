VGaboon Viper Skull - The Gaboon viper is native to central and western Africa. Gaboons possess the largest fangs of any venomous snake, measuring up to 2" in length. Its thick body and distinct markings make this species easily distinguishable from most other snakes. The Gaboons venom is a combination of hemotoxin and neurotoxin, effecting both the blood and nervous systems. The Gaboons bite is deadly to humans if left untreated.This original specimen resides in the Museum of Osteology collection.
