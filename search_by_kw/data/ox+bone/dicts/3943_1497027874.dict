VPileated Woodpecker - Reaching the size of a crow, the pileated woodpecker is the largest woodpecker found in the United States. This species makes large characteristic rectangular holes in dead trees in which it nests. The pileated ranges in much of eastern half of North America, west through central Canada into British Columbia, Oregon and Washington. Like all woodpeckers, the pileated uses its strong beak to "peck" into trees for insects to eat.
