VBonobo Skull - Sometimes called the pygmy chimp, the Bonobo is a species distinct from the "common" chimp, P. troglodytes. Its behavior, especially among females, is thought to resemble humans\u2019 more than the common chimp\u2019s. Living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire), the Bonobo is smaller, has more webbing between its toes and less sexual dimorphism than the common chimp.
