VThe Owl Monkey, also called the night monkey, is one of the only nocturnal monkeys. The huge eyes found in this species allow for more light absorbing rods, and in turn, better night vision. The owl monkey is arboreal and omnivorous eating fruits, flower nectar and insects. Owl monkeys are native to the rainforests of Central and South America.This original specimen resides in the Museum of Osteology collection.
