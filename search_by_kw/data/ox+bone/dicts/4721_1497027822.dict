VOriginally cast and reconstructed by the late Dr. Grover Krantz, Professor of Anthropology at Washington State University and famed bigfoot researcher, this pair of footprint impressions is believed to depict a crippled Sasquatch. Discovered in Bossburg, Washington State, 1969, these replica footprints capture all the textural detail of the original plaster cast including Dr. Krantz's engraved depiction of the individual bones. Tracks are also available individually."These Krantz casts have been endorsed by the International Cryptozoology Museum as a useful teaching tool in classrooms."
