VThe giraffe, reaching heights up to nineteen feet, is the tallest terrestrial animal living today. Native to Africa, the giraffe feeds on leaves that are out of reach of most other herbivores. In addition, their long tongue allows the giraffe to delicately pluck foliage from amongst the sharp thorns of the Acacia tree. The horns of the giraffe are bumpy hair covered knobs that grow slowly throughout the animals life.This bag-o-bones has been photographed with a ruler to show size. These bones and cartilage made up the chest of the giraffe and would make fantastic additions to any collection. Please see photos for details. Call with any questions.
