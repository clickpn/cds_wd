VBottle-nosed Dolphin Skull - The bottle-nosed dolphin is probably the best known Cetacean. The bottle-nosed dolphin is found throughout most of the worlds oceans. This species, like most dolphins, uses an advanced sonar system for locating, and sometimes confusing, prey fish. Considerably intelligent, the bottle-nosed dolphin has been trained to perform in parks, on television and for military uses.
