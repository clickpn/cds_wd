VHammerhead Fruit Bat Skull - The hammerhead bat, native to the rainforests of central Africa, is the largest of the African bats. The male of this strange-looking species possess a large inflated snout, providing its name. Hammerhead bats are primarily fruit eaters that specialize in figs and other soft fruits, but have also been known to prey on small birds and mammals.
