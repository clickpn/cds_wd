VThe Eastern Bluebird, is a medium-sized thrush found in open woodlands, farmlands and orchards, and most recently can be spotted in surburban areas. Approximately two-thirds of the diet of an adult eastern bluebird consists of insects and other invertebrates. The remainder of the bird's diet is made up of wild fruits.
