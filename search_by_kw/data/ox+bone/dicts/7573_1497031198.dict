VThe amazon tree boa is one of the many tree boas native to the South American amazon rainforest. These boas have very large teeth designed for grabbing birds in mid-flight. These boas come in a variety of colors. Some specimens can be colored bright orange and yellow, while others will be very dark brown and black. This one-of-a-kind skull has no damage and is a beautiful representation of its species.
