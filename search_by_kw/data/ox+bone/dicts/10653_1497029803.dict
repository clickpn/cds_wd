VAlthough the Peccary, also known as the Javelina may appear somewhat pig-like externally, they actually belong to their own family the Tayassuidae. The name javelina is Spanish and comes from their long, sharp, javelin-like canines. Peccaries use these sharp tusks to fight off many predators. This peccary skeleton is a great example of the species. This dis-articulated skeleton would make a great addition to any collection.Skeleton may have one or more broken ribs.
