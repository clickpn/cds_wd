VReeve\u2019s Muntjac Skull - The Reeve\u2019s muntjac, also called the Chinese muntjac, is native to China and Taiwan, but has been introduced to parts of Europe where they are now a feral species. Male muntjac, like other deer, grow and shed antlers annually. However, unlike other deer, muntjac antlers are fairly small and not used for sparing. Instead, they grow large canines for this purpose.This original specimen resides in the Museum of Osteology collection.
