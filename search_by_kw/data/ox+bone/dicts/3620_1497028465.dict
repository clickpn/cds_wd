VThis huge vertebra was cast from our 40-foot long female Humpback Whale skeleton that hangs in the Museum of Osteology. Measuring 26" high and 33" wide, this is a very impressive bone. The individual epiphyseal disks are cast separately and removable. This specimen was cast to retain the natural weight and feel of the original specimen.This original specimen resides in the Museum of Osteology collection.
