VSpotted Seal Skull - Spotted seals, also called largha seals, are named for their spotted pelts. This species feeds on various schooling fishes, flounder, squid and crustaceans. The spotted seal is gregarious, sometimes herding together in groups numbering into the thousands. At one time scientists believed this species and the harbor seal to be the same.
