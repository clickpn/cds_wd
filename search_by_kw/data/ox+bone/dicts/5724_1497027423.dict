VThis adult European male skull, cast from a real bone specimen, exhibits blunt trauma to the head. The rounded, depressed nature of the two wounds is consistent with prior hammer injury. The smooth, rounded edges are indicative of healing, and therefore indicate some period, likely months or years, of survival after the trauma was sustained. This specimen is a great addition to any forensics collection.
