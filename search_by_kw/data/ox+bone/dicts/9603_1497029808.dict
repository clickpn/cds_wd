VThe hog-nosed skunk is native to the desert southwest of North America. Like most skunks, the hog-nosed skunk can emit a noxious spray when defending itself from danger and is easily recognized by its characteristic black and white warning colors. The hog-nosed skunk is omnivorous, eating a variety of plants, insects, carrion and small vertebrates.This skeleton exhibits beautiful bone quality, and may exhibit some minor imperfections such as a missing distal, broken rib, ect.This would be a great candidate for articulation. Please see photos for details.
