VThe uromastyx is a genus of agamid lizard whose members are better-known as spiny-tailed lizards. These reptiles are primarily herbivorous, but occasionally eat insects, especially when young. They spend most of their waking hours basking in the sun, or hiding in underground chambers at daytime or when danger appears. They tend to establish themselves in hilly, rocky areas with good shelter and accessible vegetation.This beautiful skull has no damage and is a great example of the species. Please see photos for detail. Please call with any questions.
