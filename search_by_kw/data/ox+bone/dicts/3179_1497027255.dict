VThe Chinese water deer is a small cervid, native to regions of China, Southeast Asia and has been introduced in Europe. Unlike many deer species, the water deer males do not grow antlers. Instead, they develop long saber-like canines. These are used in display and in dominance battles with other males. The water deer is a browser feeding mostly on leaves, berries, saplings and other plant parts.This original specimen resides in the Museum of Osteology collection.
