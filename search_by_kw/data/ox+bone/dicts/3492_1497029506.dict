VHarp Seal Skull - The harp seal, also called the Greenland and saddleback seal, is found in the Arctic and northern Atlantic oceans. Primarily pelagic, harp seals live in the open sea and on pack ice. Harp seals can grow up to 6 ft.(2m) in length and 350 lbs.(160 kg) in weight. This species is carnivorous feeding on fish, crabs and other invertebrates. Harp seals migrate annually in search of food. Amazingly, these migrations can cover over 6000 miles (9600 km).
