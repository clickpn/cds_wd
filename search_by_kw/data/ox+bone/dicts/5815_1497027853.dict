VThis skull is unusually masculine in form. It exhibits large supraorbital and nuchal ridges, large mastoid process, and extreme flaring of mandible, among other traits. There is evidence of trauma to the base of the skull. Both styloid processes of the temporal bones show evidence of fracture and healing, and the lateral pterygoid plates of the sphenoid are enlarged, asymmetrical, and irregular in form.This original specimen resides in the Museum of Osteology collection.
