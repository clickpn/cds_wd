VGreen Iquana Skull - Known as the common or green iguana, this large lizard is native to Central and South America. Reaching a length in excess of six feet, the iguana feeds on vegetation, fruits and occasional insects and small vertebrates. The iguana is an agile climber, spending much of its time foraging high in the rain forest canopy. Iguanas are a common pet store favorite, but due to over-hunting for human consumption, they are protected in much of their natural range.
