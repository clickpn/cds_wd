VThe domestic dog is believed to be a direct descendant from modern wolves. Dogs have been bred as pets for thousands of years with the earliest known domestication taking place as long as 12,000 years ago. Today, dogs serve man in many ways: as guides, search and rescue, for hunting purposes, to sniff out drugs or other contraband and even to track criminals. There are over 400 recognized breeds ranging from Chihuahua as the smallest example to the Irish wolfhound as the largest.This one-of-a-kind dog skull shows the animals adult teeth replacing the animals adolescent teeth. A stage in which all dogs go through, this skull would make a wonderful teaching tool. Please see photos for details. Call with any questions.
