VScarlet Ibis Skull - The scarlet ibis is named for the brilliant red coloration of its plumage. This species is native to northeastern South America, but has been introduced to Florida. The ibis uses its long slender bill for probing into shallow water and mud to forage for food. The ibis feeds on small vertebrates, crustaceans, mollusks, and aquatic insects.
