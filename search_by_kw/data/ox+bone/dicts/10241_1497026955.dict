VA member of the crow family, the yellow-billed magpie is found in a small woodland section of Central California. It is distinguished by black and white plumage with a yellow bill and a yellow streak behind the eyes. They range in length from 16 - 18 inches (40 - 45cm) and weigh about ½ lb. (226g). They are omnivorous and feed on invertebrates, small animals, eggs, fruit, carrion, nuts and food discarded by humans. A 2004 study found that up to 80% of dead magpies reported to the California Department of Health Services WNV Dead Bird Surveillance Program tested positive for West Nile Virus.
