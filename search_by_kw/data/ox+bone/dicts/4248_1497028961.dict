VTree Squirrel Skull - There are 11 species of "tree squirrels" found in North America. Tree squirrels, as their name suggests, are arboreal making their nests in hollowed trees or leafy bunches. Most species of tree squirrel are diurnal with the exception of the flying squirrels, which are nocturnal. Tree squirrels are mostly herbivorous eating nuts and other plant parts, but, depending on the species, they will occasionally feed on insects, eggs, and even birds.
