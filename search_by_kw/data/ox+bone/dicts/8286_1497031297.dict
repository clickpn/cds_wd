VThe zebra is a member of the horse family Equidae. Zebras characteristic black and white stripes help aid in camouflage through confusion. When in a herd, and thanks to these stripes, predators have a difficult time differentiating between individual zebras and therefore, can not target an individual. Of the four species of zebra, the planes zebra, Equus burchelli, is the most common. This species is nomadic, traveling many miles each day to find grazing land and water.This zebra though young is in wonderful condition and would make a nice addition to any collection.Please see photos for details.
