VBarn Owl Skull - The barn owl is found throughout much of North and South America, Africa, Europe, Australia and southeast Asia. Like most owls, the barn owl has large facial disks that function to funnel sound to their ears. This feature, along with others, makes the barn owl an excellent nocturnal hunter by allowing it to locate prey in total darkness using sound triangulation. This species feeds on a variety of small rodents, shrews and small birds.
