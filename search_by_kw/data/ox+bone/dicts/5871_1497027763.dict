VThis excellent example of a child shows a dental eruption pattern consistent with that of a 6-7-year-old. Although composed predominately of primary (deciduous) teeth, the jaws contain a mixed pattern of dentition, which serves as an excellent teaching model in the laboratory. The basilar suture (spheno-occipital synchondrosis) is completely open, a sign of skeletal immaturity and consistent with this estimated age.This original specimen resides in the Museum of Osteology collection.
