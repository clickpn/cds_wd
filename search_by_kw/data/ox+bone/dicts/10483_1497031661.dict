VThe Springbok is native to portions of southern Africa. Similar to gazelles, the springbok is actually the only member of its unique genus, Antidorcas. A highly gregarious (herd-dwelling) species, springbok herds once numbered into the millions. Due to loss of habitat and hunting pressures, herds today rarely reach over 1000 individuals.This beautiful skull shows excellent bone quality and a nice set of horns.The skull pictured is the exact specimen you will receive. Please see photos for details.
