VGreat Horned Owl Skull - The great horned owl is native to most of North and South America. This large owl feeds on invertebrates, rodents, small birds, and rabbits. The great horned owl, named for the horn-like feather tufts on its head, is a well adapted nocturnal hunter. Large eyes allow for more light absorbing rods and better night vision. This coupled with a keen sense of hearing allows this species to locate prey in the darkest conditions.
