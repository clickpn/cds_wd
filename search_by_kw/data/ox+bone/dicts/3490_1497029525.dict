VHarbor Seal Skull - The harbor seal is found in the northern Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans. This gregarious species can be seen basking on the shore in groups sometimes numbering in the thousands. The harbor seal feeds primarily on fish including cod, herring and flounder but will also partake of mollusks and crustaceans, thus causing resentment from commercial fishermen. This species can live to be 30 years old.
