VThis skull exhibits characteristics typical of a southwestern American Indian including broad, flattened, forward-projecting zygomatic bones. The facial bones are vertically aligned with a shallow nasal depression, a moderate nasal spine, an orthognathic jaw, and a vertical chin. The cranium is rounded with bulbous parietals and a complicated lambdoid suture. The orbits are rounded or squared and the zygomaxillary suture is relatively straight. The palate is wide and smoothly curved, supporting an elliptical dental row.
