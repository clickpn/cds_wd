VTree Shrew Skull - Once considered a primate, the tree shrew is not a true shrew, but is one of 16 species found in the order Scandentia. Found in eastern and southeastern Asia, these small diurnal mammals feed on a variety of fruits and insects. The tree shrew, as its name suggests, lives mostly in trees.This original specimen resides in the Museum of Osteology collection.
