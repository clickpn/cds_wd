VThe yellow-headed parrot is a beautiful, tropical bird that lives in Central America. Mostly found in Belize and Guatemala, this bird lives amongst the mangroves and scattered trees of the rainforest. It is sometimes considered a subspecies of the Yellow-crowned Amazon. Because of the bright colors and its calm disposition, this animal is very popular in the pet trade. Being highly intelligent, these birds are also very good speakers.   This wonderful skull is in fantastic condition and would make the perfect addition to any collection.
