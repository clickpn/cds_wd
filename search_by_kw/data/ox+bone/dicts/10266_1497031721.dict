VFrom time to time, both dogs and cats may experience an infection on or near a tooth. This can cause a number of different problems, so removal of the infected tooth is what veterinarians decide upon. These two skulls exhibit the result of removed canines during the animals life, and the surrounding bone has healed. Please see photos for details.Feel free to call with any questions.
