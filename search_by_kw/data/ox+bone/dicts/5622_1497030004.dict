VThe middle ear contains three tiny bones known as ossicles; the malleus, the incus and the stapes. The ossicles were named, in Latin,  for their distinctive shapes; malleus = hammer, incus = anvil, and stapes = stirrup. The ossicles directly couple sound energy from the ear drum to the oval window of the cochlea.
