VAustralopithecus aethiopicus, widely thought to be the ancestor of A. robustus and A. boisei, is considered to be the link between A. afarensis and A. boisei. The most well known of the few fossil finds of this species is the famous KNM-WT 1700, or "Black Skull", from Lake Turkana, Kenya. This species, originally designated as Paraustralopithecus aethiopicus, was first discovered in 1967 on the Omo River of Ethiopia.
