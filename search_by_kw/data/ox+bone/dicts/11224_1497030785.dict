They have a long head with a pointed snout and long whiskers. All opossums have long, prehensile tails with a scaly appearance. Opossums are omnivores with a wide diet including fruits, grains, insects and carrion.The calcium in the bones have been stained with Alizarin Red, and the hyaline cartilage with Alcian Blue, allowing you to see the ends of the bones, trachea, and larynx.
