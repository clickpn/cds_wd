VSlender Loris Skull - The slender loris is a small, nocturnal primate native to the tropical rainforests of Southern India and Sri Lanka. This species is arboreal, spending most of its life in trees. The slender loris is primarily insectivorous, but will also eat slugs, leaves, flowers, eggs and nestlings. Due to habitat destruction and supposed traditional medicinal use, slender loris populations have greatly declined.This original specimen resides in the Museum of Osteology collection.
