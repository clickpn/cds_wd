VSouthwest Lizard Salamander ? Double Outlet Cover Plate by LaZart 6915CC                                                      Product Description:                                                                                                        This measures approx. 5" X 8", and came in a package that was marked LAZART, and was also marked REVERSIBLE, and in some cases there may be a great deal of difference in between the front and the back sides. These do not come with screws, if you need screws please ask! These are old Store Stock that were stored for several years and  were never sold!                    The packages were not in very good  shape, and have been discarded. Because these are handmade, there may be  some color variation and yours may not be an exact match with the one  photographed, but it will be close, if this bothers you, please do not  buy.   Please look at all photos and please ask any and all questions  prior to looking, Thanks!
