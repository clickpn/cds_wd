V"Great Blue Heron""Great Blue Heron" by John J. Audubon (1780-1851). This Fine Art Print was carefully printed and limited to 100 prints, each print is hand numbered. The image is printed on mold-made, 100% cotton rag watercolor paper imported from France. The image size is 10.5"w X 15"h. The paper size is 15" x 22".We use the same printer as the Museum of Fine Art in Boston. The image is printed "Giclee". Giclee is a high-resolution digital print that is created by a series of tiny jets spraying millions of droplets of printing ink onto the highest quality archival artists' paper. The spray generates more than four million droplets of ink per second; hence, the name Giclee, which is French for "fine spray." A precise computer control panel insures consistency of hue, value, and density. Giclees are of such phenomenal quality that even some art experts have difficulty telling a Giclee from an original. This fact has prompted museums and collectors to substitute Giclees for originals, thereby safeguarding priceless works in vaults. Since the Giclee process produces a combination of 512 chromatic changes (with over three and one-half million colors possible) and the resolution is two to three times that of lithographs or serigraphy, a Giclee captures every nuance of an original.Guaranteed to be in mint/new condition. The result is a stunning work, handsome, moody and would look great with any decor.Look and see what other collectors have said!"The art print came today and it looks great.
