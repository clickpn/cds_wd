VJohn James Audubon (1785-1851) was the premier naturalist and a well respected American ornithologist. His attention to detail and his prints became world famous as they were published. Future generations including Charles Darwin all drew on his expertise through his published legacy. These prints drawn over the course of his life are as true and accurate today as they were in the 1700's, sadly, some species will never be seen except in his drawings. by Audubon, John James - 1827
