VPlease note that this is an art glass panel rather than a stained glass panel. Art glass and stained glass do differ. Art glass panels are lighter and and the glass is thinner than in stained glass panels. Stained glass panels consist of individual pieces of stained glass soldered together to form a pattern. Art glass panels are created by placing thin lead strands on a sheet of solid glass to define the pattern and then hand-painting. Heat is then applied to bond the lead and paint to the glass.Great Blue HeronVertical Hand Painted Art Glass Panel14" wide x 20.5" highFREE SHIPPINGThe dramatic colors and contemporary styling of this Great Blue Heron design makes it a winner!This vertical panel is zinc-framed and measures 14" wide x 20.5" high.
