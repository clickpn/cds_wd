VSize: Canvas 32.4" x 24" / Image: 28.4" x 20"This is a fine reproduction of the magnificent  painting Great Blue Heron 1821, an excellent masterpiece created by John James Audubon, which has now been printed on Fine Art Canvas.Description of the Artwork. The Great Blue Heron stands four feet tall and has a wing span that approaches six feet. It was painted by Audubon in Louisiana in 1821. He painted over the foreground with oil, probably in London, just before it was engraved by Havell in 1834. Also known as Ardea herodias.About the Artist. John James Audubon (1785\u20131851) was a French-American ornithologist, naturalist, hunter, and painter. He painted, catalogued, and described the birds of North America in a form far superior to what had gone before. In his outsize personality and achievements, he seemed to represent the new American nation of the United States. Audubon was born in Les Cayes, Haiti (then the colony of Saint-Domingue in the Caribbean) on his father's sugar plantation. ABOUT OUR FINE ART CANVAS PRINTS.
