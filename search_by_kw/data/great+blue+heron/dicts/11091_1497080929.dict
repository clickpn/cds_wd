It is also called the common wildebeest, black-tailed wildebeest or the white-bearded wildebeest and shares its name with only one other type of specie - the black wildebeest. Males can weigh over 600 lbs growing horns that curve horizontally outward from the head, making a curl back inward toward the tip. Wildebeest require water every few days, so a near by water source is vital to combat the heat of the African plains. This need for water often brings them to rivers, where they must avoid land predators such as the Lion and Hyena, as well as Crocodiles that lie patiently in the water ready to ambush the Wildebeest as it comes to drink at the rivers edge. Their diet consists mostly of grasses and short green vegetation, as their rounded mouth makes eating other browse difficult.Record Book Score Classes for the Blue Wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus)Safari Club InternationalBoone & CrocketPope & YoungStandardBowStandardBowGold - 81"Silver - 76 2/8"Bronze - 70"Gold - 79 7/8"Silver - 76 2/8"Bronze - 70"Awards - N/AAll-Time - N/AMinimum - N/A SpecificationsDimensions:*Depth: 11"Height: 11"Width: 28"Weight: 4 lbsHorn/Antler Length (R): 27"Horn/Antler Length (L): 26"Base Circumference (R): 11"Base Circumference (L): 11"Tip to Tip Spread: 19"
