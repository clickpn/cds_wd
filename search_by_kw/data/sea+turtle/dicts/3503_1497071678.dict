This solitary species spends much of its time searching reefs and continental shelves for food. Hawksbill turtles feed mainly on sea sponges, many of which are toxic to most species, but will also take sea jellies, fish, mollusks, crustaceans, alges and other sea plants. This species has long been hunted by humans for its shell and scutes. Due to a recent decline in populations, this species is now protected and the trade in hawksbill products in banned World Wide.
