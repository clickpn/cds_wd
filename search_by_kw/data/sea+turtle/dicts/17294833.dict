VThis unique and exclusive batik painting on cotton is delicately hand drawn using the 'canting' and 'tulis' methods, whereby hot wax is flown from the canting's tiny, downward-curving spouts straight onto the cotton cloth decorously then vividly painted by the grand master batik artist, Myono.Sea turtles propel themselves through the sapphire sea with strong flippers. Bright coral and seashells bring colour to their ocean home. Mindful of the value of every species, Myono meticulously paints the images on cotton cloth applying exquisite batik techniques.The frame is not included and it is used for illustration purposes only.
