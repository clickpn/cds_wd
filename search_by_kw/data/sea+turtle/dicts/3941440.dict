VAmber and white art glass sea turtle, rare Murano(?)  mid century ashtray . This guy has a ton of personality, either swimming on his back as intended, or on his feet to show off his jaunty beret! About 8" long from nosetip to tail, 5 1/4" across belly, and almost 5" tall. Could not see any chips or cracks, this was recently brought out of 30 year storage.Visit Midcentury Marilyn's for more glass and ceramic pieces and other vintage treasures, combined shipping offered if items can safely ship together.
