VThis unique and exclusive batik painting on cotton is delicately hand drawn using the 'canting' and 'tulis' methods, whereby hot wax is flown from the canting's tiny, downward-curving spouts straight onto the cotton cloth decorously then vividly painted by the master batik artist, Agung.Fascinated by marine life, the artisan depicts a picture of life underwater. The artisan seemed to have captured their movement through still waters. Sea turtles are painted on a piece of cloth using various batik techniques. With a colorful palette and masterful batik technique, he shares their mystique and beauty.The frame is not included and it is used for illustration purposes only.
