VPRODEN Plaqueoff for Humans! Kills Plaque on Your Teeth! The dentist will Love UThis item backordered until end of May and will not be shipped until then.This sale is for presales and all orders will be shipped in they order they are received.DETAILS:ProDen PlaqueOff\u2122 contains especially selected seaweed (SW1313). This entirely natural product is harvested from the seas of Norway and Iceland and put into easy to swallow vegetarian gel-caps.Rich in natural iodine, minerals and trace elementsFree from artificial colors and preservatives, gluten and sugarRecommended 2 tablets taken daily with food120 Tabs to a bottle.Plaque bacteria constantly form in the mouth and easily adhere to teeth and gums. If allowed to accumulate it can lead to bleeding and gum inflammation (gingivitis) and over time may even cause tooth loss. Plaque can also become hardened into tartar (calculus) which is very difficult to remove.The best way of preventing gum disease is by removing plaque regularly and thoroughly with the use of a toothbrush and specialist aids designed for cleaning between the teeth.It is recognised by the dental profession that a substantial number of people are not able to adequately control plaque. The most recent government data shows that even those adults who brush their teeth twice daily, almost three quarters had some visible plaque on their teeth and 73% had some tartar (calculus) deposits.Clearly a product such as ProDen PlaqueOff\u2122 is complimentary to tooth brushing and interdental cleaning in helping to control plaque and tartar (calculus) and it would be particularly beneficial for people unable to effectively control plaque through traditional methods.How does it work?Unlike other methods of plaque control ProDen PlaqueOff\u2122 is swallowed and works systemically through the blood stream. It is thought to exert an effect through the saliva by affecting the ability of plaque to "stick" to oral surfaces, and by softening hard tartar (calculus) deposits. Improvements are normally seen within 5 - 8 weeks.This stuff works!!I have been using it for 6 months now and my hygienist is impressed. I used to build alot of plaque on my bottom teeth due to the high amount of tea I drink. It's gone now!!PAYMENT:Pay Pal Please SHIPPING: Shipped Free in the uSA Design By: FreeproductDesigns 4ffc,RcmdId ViewItemDescV4,RlogId p4%60bo7%60jtb9%3Fuk.rp*77%3E4ffc-13dc09d6915-0x100-->
