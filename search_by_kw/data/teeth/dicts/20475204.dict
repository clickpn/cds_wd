This is the finest CAPODIMONTE DIRECTLY FROM ITALY, this sculpture is hand made and hand painted in the tradition that started in Italy in the 18th Century This is part of the The Laurenz Classic Collection. This is the Rolls Royce of Porcelains made in Italy. This was created by Enzo Arzenton. He is an Italian sculptor who suddenly took ill and closed his shop in Italy. He did all the molds, fired all the pieces, and hand painted all the pieces to his perfection. This is truly a work of art About the Sculptor: Enzo Arzenton, a native of Vicenza Italy, has won many awards for his sculptures. These include the 'LEONE D' ORO" AND THE APOLLO D'ORO." He attended the Institute of Art in Vicenza and in 1976 received membership in the prestigious Tiberian Academy of Rome. Known as an innovative artist he developed various techniques which have made it possible to create porcelain figurines previously considered technically impossible. Strong composition, as excellent eye for detail and a gift for capturing the spirit of each subject characterized his Capodimonte sculptures. Arzenton's rendition is considered the best artist that is able to express his art work in the Italian traditions from the 18th Century art work in our century. This is just one of his finest pieces or art work                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Remember I am here for you at any time and I am very happy to answer any of your questions.International looking is welcomed This item comes to you from a smoke free home.Check out sellers other great bargins this week.This picture does not do this item any justice at all must by it to see for your selfGood luck with your buy and I hope you win.
