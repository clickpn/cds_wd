VThis is a professional quality black synthetic fiber Walrus styled mustache hand tied to a fine net foundation.  The mustache measures approximately 3 1/2" from side to side and is approximately 1" wide at the center (each half of the mustache droops down approximately 3").  This mustache requires spirit gum for a secure application.  It is excellent for any disguise need and with the right blending of makeup and/or liquid latex (we have the spirit gum and liquid latex listed for sale)  nearly impossible to tell it is fake.   New and never worn.  (Ref: 12/)***note***When we say NEW, we do not mean it was made yesterday. We mean it has had no previous owners other then US and the manufacturer.ALL SALES ARE FINAL.
