VGot fish, well if you do this little guy would really like some. His name is Paddy the Walrus made by *Steiff/Germany. His line was made from 1959-1969. He was bought by our family (way back) when he came out and has been pack away all these years. He is made of Mohair and in good condition. Paddy has his tag and button (#4314.00, this number also went to the 3 inch and 8 inch one. There were also other Steiff animals named Paddy like....Paddy the Beaver, Leopard, Lion and some of their teddies, but they each had different numbers). He is 5 inches and still has his tusks. A wonderful addition to any Steiff collection or as a gift.*(Steiff is the world\u2019s oldest plush manufacturer. Founded in 1880 by Margarete Steiff, a seamstress who was limited to sewing with one hand due to polio, the company has grown to be synonymous with top quality the world over.Steiff is best known as the company that invented the Teddy bear.  In 1902, Richard Steiff, a nephew of Margarete and a gifted artist/inventor, presented the idea to Margarete. At first, she was not enthusiastic.  But with Richard\u2019s persistence, she finally relented. And the rest is history. The famous \u201cButton in Ear\u201d trademark, introduced by Franz Steiff, another of Margarete\u2019s nephews, in 1904, distinguishes every Steiff Teddy bear or animal)(A $2.00 fee has been added to the price for insurance during shipping)
