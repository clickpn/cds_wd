I am not a member of the 'Postcard Traders Association'. Their grading systems follows and I am following their guidelines in grading the cards which I have listed:Excellent ( Ex.) No obvious flaws. Sharp corners, clean and if postally used, writing does not detract from appearance.Very Good ( VG ) Minor defects such as album marks, signs of age and handling acceptable that do not detract from a visually pleasing card.Good (G) Noticeable defects, handling and wear apparent. Slight creasing and minor postal damage not detrimental to image acceptable in this category.Fair (F) Obvious creasing, staining, small tears or damp damage evident. Significant edge or corner damage. Just about in a collectible state.Poor (P) Incomplete, image seriously affected. A gap filler only!Condition Grading on the Internet When selling postcards on the internet the image should be a true representation of the item. Images should show edge definition.
