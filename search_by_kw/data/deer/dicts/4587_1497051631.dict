VTufted Deer Skull - The tufted deer, named for the hair tufts that hide the males tiny antlers, are native to forested regions of Myanmar (Burma) and south central China. Apart from being slightly larger, this species is very similar to the muntjac in appearance. Also like muntjac, male tufted deer have large canines used for sparing. Tufted deer are herbivorous, feeding on various leaves, twigs, fruits, and grasses. The tufted deer will sound a high pitched bark when alarmed.
