VErmator T18000 Three-Phase HEPA Dust Extractor. The most powerful 480V HEPA Dust Extractor on the market today. Greatly expanded pre-filter surface area acts as a built-in pre-separator providing superior cyclonic separation for long, uninterrupted service periods. The T18000 produces plenty of airflow to handle a single four-head grinder or two each three-head grinders. T18000 is the only extractor that can keep up with a larger shaver. Clean air exhaust is guaranteed through four individually tested and certified HEPA filters. The intake port connects to a Y-connector where one or two 3" hoses can be connected. When used with one hose, up to 100-feet in length can be used. The out-port allows venting of the exhaust air away from the work area or outside of the building via a hose connection. Jet Pulse efficiently cleans pre-filter without exposing operator to dust. The unique 70-foot "Longopac" allows fast, drop-down, dust-free disposal into approximately 25 individually sealed bags. Comes with a 3-inch, 33-foot hose, and a single 4-inch to double 3-inch Y connector. When used with two 3-head grinders (up to 32" wide), and to achieve best results, a pre-separator should be connected between each grinder and the T18000. Distribution Box Included.
