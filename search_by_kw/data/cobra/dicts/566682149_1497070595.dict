The list of features of induction fixtures  is so impressive that induction lighting is emerging as one of the best technologies in lighting. The 100,000 hour rated life, induction lighting fixtures may never need replacing. Induction Lighting is even more attractive and useful in applications where lamp replacement is very difficult and expensive, as in many outdoor applications, hard-to-reach installations such as industrial plants with 80 feet ceilings, hazardous applications like refineries, tunnels, mines, airports, and others.\u3000 Very-Long Life -100,000 hour rated life* Short Payback Time and Low Cost of Ownership - reduced energy and maintenance costs  Induction lighting is one of the best kept secrets in energy-efficient lighting. Simply stated, induction lighting is essentially a fluorescent light without electrodes or filaments, the items that frequently cause other bulbs to burn out quickly. Thus, many induction lighting units have an extremely long life of up to 100,000 hours. To put this in perspective, an induction lighting system lasting 100,000 hours will last more than 11 years in continuous 24/7 operation, and 25 years if operated 10 hours a day. Induction lighting has many superior characteristics, including the following:Virtually maintenance-free operation High efficacy\u2014in many cases, 60+ or 70+ lumens per watt Long life Excellent  (CRI)\u201480+ and in some cases 90+ Instant start and restrike operation No flickering, strobing, or noise Low-temperature operation High power factor: .90+ Quantity available more than 50.
