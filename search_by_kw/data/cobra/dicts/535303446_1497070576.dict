VNOTHING ON THE ROAD LOOKS LIKE IT OR PERFORMS LIKE IT!     The Cobra® Vedetta Ultimate Detection Systems Series sets the new standard in radar/laser detection system.      The revolutionary detection system boasts a 30 percent increase in performance over Cobra\u2019s current flagship model, providing stellar range and more than ample time to react to potential threats.    The Vedetta sports a 2.4-inch TFT color LCD display on a multi-axis hinge and a ball-socket suction cup mounting bracket, which allows the driver to mount the detector virtually anywhere on the windshield or dash of their automobile.    The display can be rotated 270 degrees vertically and 60 degrees horizontally.      Mounting radar/laser detectors on the center of the windshield has historically been critical for performance, but not necessarily ideal for driver visibility as well as unit concealment - the new bracket solves all these.    In addition to setting a new benchmark among detection systems for form factor, and driver ergonomics, SLR 650G offers an integrated GPS receiver and free, lifetime access to its AURA\u2122 national database of speed/red-light cameras and known speed trap locations.    The Cobra Vedetta Ultimate Detection Systems are designed to maximize driver comfort, safety and situational awareness of the driving environment, thereby reducing the risk of accidents and traffic violations.    Features:        Supercharged detection of all radar and laser guns.         Aura® camera and driving hazard database adds another level of protection against red light cameras, speed cameras, known speed traps & dangerous intersections. Includes updates for life.         Quad-level Intellishield® virtually eliminates false signals.         Intellimute® automatically mutes alerts at lower speeds.         Voice alert® clearly announces the type of threat detected.         Unique swivel display enables Vedetta to be mounted and viewed from practically anywhere on the windshield or dash.         Touch-sensor controls provide easy access to menus and features.         Multiple color themes to complement any dash illumination.         GPS-based 8-Point compass.         Multi-Axis, rotating windshield/dash mount to ensure that Vedetta is always aligned, level and pointing straight ahead.    Includes:        Cobra® Vedetta\u2122 SLR-650G Max Performance Radar/Laser/Camera Detector        Mount        Vehicle Charger        Retractable USB Cable        Quick Start Guide   Model No: SLR650G  Weight: 2.0 Lbs.
