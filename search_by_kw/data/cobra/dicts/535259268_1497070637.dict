VTHE MOST ADVANCED RADAR DETECTION SYSTEM IN THE WORLD!     The Cobra iRadar Detection Unit is a sleek, compact and powerful detection system. It detects all radar and laser guns on the market and Red Light Camera Detection.    Its 360° protection has you covered on all sides.    The iRadar Detection Unit is a fully functional detector with or without the Cobra iRadar app.     Without the app the detection unit will provide audio alerts to all radar and laser signals.     When combined with the app, you can change settings, view visual alerts, and gain access to Cobra\u2019s AURA database to receive red light camera alerts.    The iRadar Detection Unit also features a City/Highway mode that reduces false alerts in urban areas.    In City Mode, the unit will automatically filter out annoying false alerts caused by automatic door openers.    In Highway Mode, the iRadar Detection Unit gives you the benefit of immediate alerts.    Its large, crisp speaker provides clear and precise warnings while its escalating alerts let you know how far away the threat is.    Cobra iRadar\u2122 combines industry leading radar, laser and speed & red light camera detection technology with the power of a smart phone to provide the most advanced, smart detection system available today.    Using a smart phone\u2019s Bluetooth® wireless technology connection, Cobra iRadar enables you to view radar alerts, control settings, log alert history and be warned of upcoming speed and red-light cameras.
