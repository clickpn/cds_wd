See Below For The Reason Why Proof Coins Are The Mints Best Work.* Proof Coins Are More Valuable In General Than Most Business Strike Coins, Primarily Because Of Their Lower Mintage's. Overall Proof Mintage's Are Almost Always Lower And For Some Countries Average Less Then 1% Of The Total Coin Production. * Upgrade Or Start Your Collection Of Proof Coins. Proofs AreThe Supreme Examples Of The Art Of Coin-making. All Coins Are Made by Having Blank Discs Of The Metal Struck With Enormous Force Between Dies. This Heavy Blow Impresses The Design On Each Side Of The Blank And Also Rounds The Edge. Proof Coins Are Made Similarly But There Are Many Painstaking DifferencesFrom Business Strike Coins. Proof Blanks Are Specially Treated, Hand-Polished, And Cleaned To Ensure High-Quality Strikes. The Blanks Are Then Fed Into Presses Fitted With Specially Polished Dies And Struck at Least Twice To Ensure Sharp, High Relief. The Coins Are Then Carefully Packaged To Showcase And Preserve Their Exceptional Finish. Cameo Coins Have Exquisite Frosted Relief. The Dies Are First Blasted With Hard Particles To Create a Frosted Effect. Each Proof Coin Is Minted With Extra Pressure For The Finish Detail, Afterwards They Are Individually Inspected And Are Not Touched Except With Gloved Hands. Even The Air Is Filtered To Exclude a Dust Free Environment.
