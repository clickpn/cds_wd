Pickup / inspection welcome at our Vista, CA warehouse.Disclaimer:Due to the nature of natural stones, every unit will have a slightly different variation in color, texture, veins, and minor imperfections. This is natural for stone surfaces and is not considered defective. We highly recommend sealing the stone surfaces before installation to avoid any dirt / stain to get into the stone. Cabinet finishes can also appear different with each computer based on monitor settings, etc. The actual color will vary slightly due to each color / brightness settings. It is normal if any pits, grooves, or knotty wood areas are on the cabinet surface, as this is a solid wood cabinet. It is considered normal.The backsplashes are also not normally included, due to the fragile nature of them during shipping. Plus they are nearly impossible to replace. We are including them FREE of charge on this listing, but we can't replace them if they get damaged. (all other parts are 100% insured) We just have no way to ship a backsplash by itself safely. However, in the rare even they do crack, they are actually very easy to fix.
