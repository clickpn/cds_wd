Adult walruses are distinguished by their prominent tusks, flippers, and unique body shape. Adult males in the Pacific can weigh up to 4500 pounds. Walruses are most often found in shallow water above the continental shelves, spending most of their lives on the sea ice looking for mollusks to eat. Walruses are relatively long-lived, social animals, and they are considered to be a "keystone species" in the Arctic marine regions. The walrus has played a prominent role in the cultures of many indigenous Arctic peoples, who have hunted the walrus for its meat, fat, skin, tusks, and bone. Products made by natives such as the one in this listing help many indigenous artists make their living.SpecificationsDimensions:*Depth: 1"Height: 2 6/8"Width: 1 7/8"Weight: < 1 lbs
