VArgan oil Argan oil comes from the nuts of the Argan tree (Argania spinosa).This tree is unknown for many people since it grows only in the South Western part of Morocco in an area covering 700,000-800,000 hectares.The argan tree produces nuts from which is extracted a very nutritious oil.The remaining is used to feed the cattle and nuts shells for heating. Nothing is lost.For centuries, Berber women of this region have produced argan oil which was used for their consumption and traditional Moroccan medicine.People abroad are more and more interested in this oil either for its cosmetic and nutritional properties.A threatened tree  The argan tree is a very resistant tree which can live from 150 to 200 years. It is perfectly adapted to the aridity of the South Western regions of Morocco.Its roots grow deep in search of water and thus help retain the soil, preventing erosion and limiting the advance of the desert.Argan tree plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance and the economic situation of the population. In 1999, UNESCO added the argan tree to the World Heritage List.In less than a century, more than a third of the argan forest has disappeared. Would you like to grow an Aragan tree in your yard?
