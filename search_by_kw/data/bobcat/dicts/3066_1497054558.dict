VBobcat Skull - The Bobcat is indigenous throughout North America. There is some to dispute as to which genus it should be assigned, with both Felis rufus and Lynx rufus being sited. Bobcats are strict carnivores (meat eaters). Stealthy hunters, they stalk their prey, then pounce and, if successful, kill with a bite to the neck.
