VCheetah Skull - The cheetah, native to sub Saharan Africa, is considered to be the fastest land mammal. Their quick bursts of speed have been clocked in excess of 70 mph. This diurnal species hunts in the early morning and late afternoon to avoid the African heat. Cheetahs mainly feed on small gazelles, monkeys, rabbits and other small vertebrates. Cheetahs were once kept as pets in the Middle East nearly 3000 years ago.
