It's quality and looks will keep you far above the rest of the crowd. Hilason is among the best in Material, Craftmanship and price in the entire country.This pair of Chaps is made from some of the best Cowhide Hair-on Leather available. Only the best leather is selected from a range of suppliers, so that you get the best because you deserve the best. The hair on this chaps is 100% original and are tanned in the best way possible to ensure that they are resistant to wear and tear and do not simply fall off. The leather is thick and heavy quality cowhide that is soft and supple to give you that comfortable and elegant fit. The Yoke of the Chaps is made from High Quality Skirting leather. It has some attractive Handtooled design on it. The belt and leg straps are made from the same quality skirting leather. The chaps are decorated with attractive eye catching trims. The trims have contrasting colors, shape and style. They are artistically hand cut and precisely stitched to give a really sharp and "Attention Demanding" look. The buckles are made of quality Brass with nickel coating for a durable and everlasting shine. The slotted conchos are made of Hand Engraved Silver with Brass base. The fringes are precisely cut from thick quality Suede leather.When considering a Rodeo Chap, two factors are of prime importance. It is necessary to confirm that the chap is put together very intellectually with precise enforcement at stress point to ensure durability and long life. Hilason Chaps are just designed with that feature. Each stress point has been identified and reinforced with extra material, padding or stitching as and where needed.The other issue to consider is weight. The chap should be made of significant weight, otherwise a light-weight chap would be at interference in rodeo spinning and flying wildly. This chap uses a custom-tanned cowhide leather that gives it the desired weight and uniformity that is important in Rodeo.In addition to durability, this chap is really easy to clean and dust-off. Simple soft brush could be used for dusting or a combination of damp cloth and mild liquid soap can be used for spot-cleaning. Avoid rubbing the cloth aggressively.Past ReviewsPayment TermsShipping TermsReturn PoliciesCustomer ServicesCommentFromDate / TimeItem #Great ChapsSeller johnboyisno1( 41  ) 7/19/2011 4:05:17 AM250836675070great item, Super fast ShippingSeller rebelgirl_81( 59  ) 7/7/2011 6:12:35 PM250845483741lovelySeller secret11136( 610  ) 7/1/2011 4:34:54 PM270753915170fast shippingSeller wpaintball44( 55  ) 7/1/2011 2:07:05 PM270740640542Nice Chaps for a nice price.Seller dman58( 3  ) 6/28/2011 1:31:45 AM230625697869arrived on time,as described, good seller, would reccomendSeller shine22765( 19  ) 5/18/2011 2:35:52 PM230617006149Great customer service.
