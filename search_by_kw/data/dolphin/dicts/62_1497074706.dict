VThe family Platanistidae includes two river dolphins, the Ganges and the Indus, both named for the rivers they inhabit. It is debated weather the dolphins represent individual species or are merely subspecies. Both the Ganges and Indus river dolphins are considered critically endangered due to pollution, fishing net entanglements and over hunting by humans.
