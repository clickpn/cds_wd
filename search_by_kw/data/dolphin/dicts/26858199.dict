We are pretty new to eCRATER but we have hundreds of positive reviews across the web. Visit our website to read some testimonials!www.GoldenGloryAuthentics.comWHY CHOOSE US?At Golden Glory Authentics we specialize in gallery quality custom framing of autographed sports jerseys. Our products are crafted by hand using only the finest museum quality materials. With real wood molding imported from Italy, and all acid-free conservation materials to protect the jersey, our custom framings are built to last generations.Do not be fooled by a cheap low quality generic framed jersey with inferior materials. Sure you may find a framed jersey online for a bit cheaper, but like most things in life, you get what you pay for. Most places use shallow frames made of cheap particleboard wood, or even plastic-composite. They are so shallow that your jersey ends up pressed flat against the glass, which is not the correct way to frame a jersey. An autograph on a fabric jersey needs space to breathe. Without the proper space the ink can bleed and the autograph becomes smudged over time losing its value. Notice that most places will only show you one picture from straight on, and from far away? Sure it may look good in a picture online but once you receive the item you'll quickly find that pictures can be misleading... At Golden Glory Authentics we take multiple photos from close up and from many angles, this showcases our detail and the high quality craftsmanship that separates us from others. If you're looking for a premier item you're at the right place.Don't waste hours of your time and get overcharged to have your valuable jersey done at a local frame shop. A high quality job can easily cost $1000 at a frame shop and that DOES NOT EVEN include the cost of the jersey or anything else you want framed with it. They may be good at framing artwork, but jerseys take a special skill set and thousands of hours of practice to become an expert. Most framers might do one or two jerseys per year, and they just don't have the skill level or experience to do a fabulous job like we do. With us what you see is what you get, while at a local shop you never know what the finished product will look like. At a frame shop you'll spend hours of valuable time, spend hundreds of dollars more, and wait an entire month to get it back and you could be highly disappointed. Furthermore, with us we provide the photos, team logos or trading cards, and a one of a kind custom plaque that you wont find ANYWHERE ELSE! It looks absolutely amazing and has all the players\u2019 career achievements. All of this comes included. At a frame shop you'll have to provide the photos and other elements you want framed, spending even more of your time and money getting them first.At Golden Glory Authentics we specialize in jerseys so trust the experts to deliver the best product at a fraction of the cost.
