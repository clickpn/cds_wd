VLa Plata River Dolphin Skull - Also called the Franciscana dolphin, the La Plata river dolphin inhabits coastal marine waters as well as fresh water river basins. This species ranges from the southeastern coast of Brazil south to central Argentina. This carnivore feeds exclusively on fish, which unfortunately causes conflict with commercial fishing operations. The La Plata river dolphin is one of the smallest cetaceans reaching 5' (1.6 m) in length and weighing 95 lbs. (43 kg).
