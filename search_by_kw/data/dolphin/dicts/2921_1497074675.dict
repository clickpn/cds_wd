VAmazon River Dolphin Skull - The Amazon river dolphin, as its name would suggest, is found throughout the Amazon and many of its tributaries. This species ranges in two color forms from gray to pink. Legends from local indigenous people hold the pink form of this species as sacred and often blame it for "immaculate" conceptions. Amazon dolphins are one of four species of fresh water dolphins found in the tropics of South America and Asia.
