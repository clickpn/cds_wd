Also known widely as a dorado, it is one of two members of the Coryphaenidae family, the other being the pompano dolphinfish. The name mahi-mahi means 'very strong' in the native Hawaiian culture. The common English name of dolphin causes much confusion as this fish is not related to the marine mammals known as dolphins (family Delphinidae). Mahi-mahi seldom exceed 4 years in age and average 15 to 29 lbs in weight, with large fish being recorded near 40 lbs. Mahi-mahi have long dorsal fins running nearly the entire length of their bodies. They are distinguished by beautiful colorations of golden yellow, bright blues and emerald greens. Mahi-mahi are among the fastest-growing fish. They spawn in warm ocean currents throughout much of the year, and their young are commonly found in seaweed. Mahi-mahi are carnivorous, feeding on flying fish, crabs, squid, mackerel, and other forage fish. They have also been known to eat zooplankton and crustaceans.
