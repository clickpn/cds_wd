VNative to regions of Africa, the white rhinoceros inhabits grasslands, open woods and brush lands. This large land mammal, second only to the elephant, can weigh up to 7900 lbs (3600 kg). White rhinos are grazers feeding on a variety of grasses. This species is not white, as its name might suggest. Their name is derived from a misinterpretation of the African word \u201cwidje\u201d, meaning \u201cwide\u201d, which refers to this species wide mouth. White Rhino Horns sold separately.
