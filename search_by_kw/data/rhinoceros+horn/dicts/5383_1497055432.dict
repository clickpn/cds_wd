VBlack Rhinoceros - The black rhinoceros once ranged over much of Sub-Saharan Africa. Due to recent over hunting for its horn, this species is now only found in a handful of preserves with populations estimated around 3600 individuals. The black rhino is listed as endangered but thanks to anti-poaching and captive breeding efforts, this species numbers have been increasing.
