It preys primarily on deer, raccoon and coyote. These massive and powerful cats typically hunt at night, using a quick and fatal attack when taking down prey. They will often hide their catch, using it to feed themselves and their young from the carcass for days at a time. SpecificationsDimensions:*Depth: 36"Height: 38"Width: 66"Weight: 70 lbs
