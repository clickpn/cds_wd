VCalifornia Sea Lion Skull - The California sea lion is found along the Pacific coast of North America from British Columbia to Mexico. Sea lions are carnivores feeding on various fish, squid, crustaceans and octopus. Male sea lions outsize the females by twice. This sexual dimorphism is evident in their skulls. Males also posses a large sagital crest, mostly absent in females. This species has long been used and trained to perform in circuses and zoos.This wonderful specimen was acquired from an old research collection dating back to the 1940's.
