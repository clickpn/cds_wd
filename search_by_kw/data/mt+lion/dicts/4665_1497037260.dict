VMountain Lion Skull - Also known as puma, American lion, panther, and cougar, this giant cat makes its home in mountains, deserts and jungles throughout North and South America. The mountain lion feeds on a variety of small to large vertebrates including rabbits, deer, sheep and birds. Although the voice of the mountain lion is like that of a domestic cat, only louder, its mating call is a harsh scream.
