VCalifornia Sea Lion Skull - The California sea lion is found along the Pacific coast of North America from British Columbia to Mexico. Sea lions are carnivores feeding on various fish, squid, crustaceans and octopus. Male sea lions outsize the females by twice. This sexual dimorphism is evident in their skulls. Males also posses a large sagital crest, mostly absent in females. This species has long been used and trained to perform in circuses and zoos.This wonderful specimen was acquired from an old research collection dating back to the 1940's. Because this specimen pre-dates the marine mammal act of 1972, this skull can legally be sold.Never before have natural-bone sea lion skulls been available at Skulls Unlimited.This specimen is a male and comes complete with its baculum. Specimen is missing five post canine teeth and six incisors. No damage is present. This specimen comes with a letter of authorization from U.S. Marine Fisheries.
