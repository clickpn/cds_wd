The lion is unmistakeable in appearance, with it's rich golden-tan coat, massive paws and weight of upwards around 500 LBS, it stands out as peaceful and lethal at the same time. The male is legendary in appearance, as mature adults grow thick, brown manes around their massive heads. Along with their appearance, the lion's call is equally haunting and powerful. The lion is native to most plains and grasslands of Africa, as well as southwestern parts of the middle east and India.SpecificationsDimensions:*Claw Length (#1): 2.125"
