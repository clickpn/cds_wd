Region 0 (Playable all over the world). NTSC Format. Includes post game interviews and the medal ceremony Important Payment Information. Please read before Ordering Currently (September 2013) I am currently not accepting any forms of electronic payment for orders. My preferred payment provider Google Checkout is closing their business in November. I am searching for a new method (Sorry I do NOT take Paypal), but the ioffer site has been slow to integrate new methods of payment.  What this means.. You can order but you have to make payment via Check or Money Order(US Postal, Western Union, or other) for USA Residents. Sorry giving me your credit card number does nothing for me as I have no way to process the payment. You can send Cash, but please wrap it well and send it with some sort of tracking number/delivery confirmation so there is not an issue about what was not received.  How to send a check, please don\u2019t simply send a check in an envelope with nothing else. Send a note stating what you are ordered, your username on ioffer, date of order and other information. You have to understand I might receive more than just your order on any given day. My mailing address is provided on the invoice you will receive AFTER making the purchase.  For International buyers this causes a greater problem, and I will try to address each situation below. And Bank Transfer is not an option; I do not give out that information to anyone.  Canada \u2013 You can get a USD payable money order or check drawn from your bank I will accept this. Also on a case by case basis I could accept CAD cash, as I sometimes visit.  European Euro Countries \u2013 I am happy to accept cash euros sent in the mail. I will for simplicity sake (and the fact I don\u2019t pay fees) use the rate of 1.4 USD = 1 Euro, so most single DVD orders will be a 10 Euro note.  United Kingdom/GB \u2013 I will also accept British Pound notes, at the rate of 1.5 USD = 1 Pound, so most single DVD orders will be a 10 Pound/Quid note.  Rest of World (inc Japan, Australia, New Zealand, etc). If you can get your hands on USD, Euros, or Pounds I would accept them in the mail at the rates above. Otherwise until I can figure out a new electronic/online payment method I\u2019m sorry that we can\u2019t do orders.  Again any questions about this, its best to ASK BEFORE you make the order, as it saves me from having to go through the process to cancel an order if you make it and then realize that you won\u2019t be able to make payment.  Thanks for reading and hope you enjoy the items.
