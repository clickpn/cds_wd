VWe used to make our less-than-perfect animal skulls available to our store customers only, since it's a little hard to describe every lost tooth and damaged nasal bone online. But since now we don't have a physical location where we can show and sell our discounted skulls, we're going to assume you understand that we can't go into much detail on each specimen, but that the skulls in our new Damaged/Bargain section are priced according to how badly off they are. So - you want a coyote skull, but it doesn't need to be pristine? Just see if there are any coyotes in that section, and get $2.50 - $10 off. Need just the upper? There's a section for that. Be aware that we don't get all that many skulls in that we consider deserving of an A2 rating - so if discounted skulls are what you want, keep a close eye on this part of the website.\u200bLynx rufusApproximately 4.5" total length.
