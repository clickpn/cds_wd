France, Helen Haye, Frank LawtonDirector: Alfred HitchcockRunTime: 87 minutesGernre: DramaLanguage: EnglishSubtitles: Greek (Optional - Removable)Region: 2 EUROPE PAL (not for the USA & Canada)Picture: --This uncharacteristic Alfred Hitchcock endeavor was adapted by Hitch and his wife, Alma Reville, from a play by John Galsworthy. The British countryside turns into an ideological battlefield when Hornblower (Edmund Gwenn), a wealthy, self-man tradesman, stakes his claim to a piece of valuable forest property controlled for literally centuries by the "landed gentry." The local squire (C.V. France) and his wife (Helen Haye) dig in their heels and refuse to acknowledge Hornblower's presence -- how dare he use mere money to challenge the rights of blood? Their genteel snobbery is every bit as obnoxious as Hornblower's brash effrontery, and the result is a film with virtually no heroes or villains whatever. Never in any future film did Hitchcock ever lobby so strong an attack on the smug implacability of the aristocracy -- perhaps wisely, since The Skin Game proved to be one of his least-successful films. .....MOVIE 2: LA CITE DES ENFANTS PERDUSCast: Ron Perlman, Daniel Emilfork, Judith Vittet, Dominique Pinon, Dominique Pinon, Jean-Claude Dreyfus, Genevieve BrunetDirector: Marc CaroRunTime: 112 minutesGernre: FantasyLanguage: FrenchSubtitles: Greek (Optional - Removable)Region: 2 EUROPE PAL (not for the USA & Canada)Picture: =master!BO4This visually inventive French sci-fi/fantasy tale began winning a cult following practically from the moment it was released. Krank (Daniel Emilfork) is a foul, monstrous creature who lords over the inhabitants of a small island, Krank's emotional being is every bit as ugly as his physical personage, largely because he does not have the ability to dream. However, he has developed a machine that can drain the dreams of others from their heads, and he devotes himself to kidnapping children from a nearby harbor town so that he can steal their pleasant dreams. Denree (Joseph Lucien) is one of the children who has been spirited off to the island, Krank discovers that he's an even bigger problem than he imagined when his big brother One (Ron Perlman), a harpoon-wielding mountain of a man, sets out on a rescue mission. Once he arrives on Krank's island, One encounters a brain in a fish tank that has learned to talk, a group of clones who can't decide who is the original, a pair of Siamese twins, an octopus that guides a group of orphaned thieves, and a girl named Miette (Judith Vittet) who says she can guide One to Denree.....We do not sell copies, bootleg, or DVD-R.
