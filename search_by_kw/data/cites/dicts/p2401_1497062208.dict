VCaracal caracal This Caracal skeleton is missing 1 small incisor. 3 ribs were broken, but were fixed well. The sternum is in 8 pieces. All distal phalanges from the fore-paws are disfigured/pathological, and one distal phalange on the back left paw is disfigured/pathological. Everything else is complete and in good condition. Beautiful specimen. *CITES Species: This item cannot be shipped outside of the U.S.*
