VThis is Another wild thing by Kamar from 1968.Her name is Betsy and she was made in Japan.She is a rare find.This is a wonderful sawdust Hippo stuffed animal. Her tail remains tightly attached. Her eyes, nose and mouth are all complete and she even has a small heart and diamond on her left side rear leg. Her yellow fur is slightly tanned from age. Her ears also remain tightly attached. I have used a lint brush on her, however, she could use additional cleaning/dusting. Approx. Measurements:7" in length (10" including straightened tail)2-1/2: in width3-1/2" in heightShe is missing her tush tag.
