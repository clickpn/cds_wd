VAuthor - Nicholas MoneyThe  overnight appearance of mushrooms in a meadow or on a suburban lawn is a  marvelous sight. It is one of many awe-inspiring, magical processes  that have evolved among the fungi, yet this group remains the least  studied and most poorly understood kingdom of organisms. In Mushroom,  Nicholas Money offers a vibrant introduction to the world of mushrooms,  investigating the science behind these organisms as well as their  enduring cultural and imaginative appeal.
