VDetailsDescription of Taxidermy For SaleThis is a great African Giraffe backskin rug. The hide, hair and tail are in very good condition. The middle of the rug has longer hair (the giraffe's dorsal side) while left and right sides of the rug have naturally thinner hair (the giraffe's ventral side). Two symmetrical stitching lines are present on both the right and left sides - this is necessary to bring the rug into 'square'. The overall craftsmanship, hair, hide and leather quality earn our Excellent\u2122 quality rating. All applicable dimensions are included to help ensure this item will fit within your intended display space.- Black Leathered trimmed border and extra thick backing for durability.- Best displayed on the floor. Special hangers could be requested if the purchaser would wish to hang this rug on the wall.About the African Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis)It's probably fair to say that the giraffe is the most exotic and instantly recognized mammal on the planet. The fact remains that the giraffe is the tallest mammal in the animal kingdom, with legs alone that often reach over 6 feet in height, the giraffe towers above all else, often just under 20 feet in total height. The giraffe's long legs allow it to run at an astonishing 35 MPH sprint, and can cruise comfortably at 10 MPH. Their tall stature and long necks provide the perfect opportunity to graze delicious tree-top vegetation, and when that isn't enough, they deploy their 20-inch tongues to finish the job!SpecificationsDimensions:*Width: 87"Length w/ Tail: 100"
