An unparalleled predator, the Wolf is known to hunt in packs, in order to take down "prey" ten-times its size. Though it looks similar to the traditional domestic dog, the wolf has longer legs, a thinner torso and a course outer-fur that sheds (molts) every spring. Wolves, though hard to spot in the wild, are found in America as far north as the Arctic, and as far south as New York, Washington and Wisconsin.
