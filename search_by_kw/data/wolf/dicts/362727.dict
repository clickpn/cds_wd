VThis is  a very nice signed print of a wolf titled "Heard, Not Seen". The original painting was done by Tom Hirata in 1995. This one is a very limited copy (152/975)  printed by White Deer Press and singed by artist Tom Hirata.  It is protected by a very nice hardwood frame with plexiglass. Overall dimension is 21"x27". Great addition to your collection! Hirata received his training from the Art Students League of New York and the Art Center College of Design in California. After working as an illustrator in New York, Tom decided to leave commercial art in 1983. In a short time his impressive record of successes have earned him recognition and respect across the country. His work has been shown in several museums including the Smithsonian, and has graced the cover of dozens of magazines including Bird Watchers Digest, Wildlife Art News, and Waterfowl USA.
