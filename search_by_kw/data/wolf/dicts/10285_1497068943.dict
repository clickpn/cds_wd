The wolf is an unparalleled predator, and is capable of hunting together with other individuals to take down "prey" up to ten times the size of an individual wolf. Though they look much like the traditional domestic dog, the wolf has longer legs, a thinner torso and a course outer-fur that sheds (molts) every spring. Wolves, though hard to spot in the wild, are found in America as far north as the Arctic, and as far south as New York, Washington and Wisconsin.
