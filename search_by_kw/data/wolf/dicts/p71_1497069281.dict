VAuthors - Christina EisenbergAnimals  such as wolves, sea otters, and sharks exert a disproportionate  influence on their environment; dramatic ecological consequences can  result when they are removed from\u2014or returned to\u2014an ecosystem.n The  Wolf\u2019s Tooth, scientist and author Cristina Eisenberg explores the  concept of \u201ctrophic cascades\u201d and the role of top predators in  regulating ecosystems. It provides clear explanations of the science  surrounding keystone predators and considers how this notion can help  provide practical solutions for restoring ecosystem health and  functioning.Hardcover
