VDetailsDescriptionThis is a great quality Grey Wolf taxidermy rug mount. It features an open mouth pose mounted head with two layers of felt bordering on the edges.- If this item is placed on the floor, we recommend only light foot traffic without boots or dirty shoes. Heavy foot traffic will damage the hair.- This item could be hung on the wall as well (hangers not included - nails or tacks could be used) About the Wolf (Canis lupis)The wolf is the world's largest and most iconic canine, and is well known for it's highly social and intellectual behavior. The wolf is an unparalleled predator, and is capable of hunting together with other individuals to take down "prey" up to ten times the size of an individual wolf. Though they look much like the traditional domestic dog, the wolf has longer legs, a thinner torso and a course outer-fur that sheds (molts) every spring. Wolves, though hard to spot in the wild, are found in America as far north as the Arctic, and as far south as New York, Washington and Wisconsin.
