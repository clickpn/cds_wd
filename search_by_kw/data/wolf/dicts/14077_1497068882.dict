VDetailsDescription of Taxidermy For SaleThis is an outstanding full-size Black Wolf taxidermy rug. It features a mounted head with a great open-mouth pose, all-natural claws, and incredibly soft, thick fur. The craftsmanship on the rug is exceptional, and includes a lovely felt bordering along the edges, earning our Excellent Plus\u2122 overall quality rating.- If this item is placed on the floor, we recommend light foot traffic (no shoes!), as heavier foot traffic will likely damage or dirty the fur.- This item may be hung on the wall as well. Hangers not included. Nails or tacks are optional.About the Wolf (Canis lupis)The wolf is the world's largest and most iconic canine, and is well known for it's highly social and intellectual behavior. The wolf is an unparalleled predator, and is capable of hunting together with other individuals to take down "prey" up to ten times the size of an individual wolf. Though they look much like the traditional domestic dog, the wolf has longer legs, a thinner torso and a course outer-fur that sheds (molts) every spring. Wolves, though hard to spot in the wild, are found in America as far north as the Arctic, and as far south as New York, Washington and Wisconsin. SpecificationsDimensions:*Nose to Tail: 70.00"Width (Front Feet): 60.00"Width (Back Feet): 61.00"
