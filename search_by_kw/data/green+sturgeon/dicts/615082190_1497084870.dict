VThe complete The Green Hornet 1966-1967 live action series in a 2 disc Blu-Ray set. This collection contains all 26 episodes of the series. It also includes the two episode crossover from the live action 1966 Batman series as a bonus feature. Digitally remastered in beautiful 1080p, this television classic from the 60s has been restored and upconverted frame by frame to provide an excellent high definition experience.

With over 12 hours of uncut, original footage, this collection is a must have for any Green Hornet, Batman, or DC comics fan.
