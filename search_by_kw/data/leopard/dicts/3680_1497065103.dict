VLeopard Seal Skull - The leopard seal is native to Antarctica and a handful surrounding islands including the Falklands, Kerguelen, South Georgia and South Shetland. This carnivorous species possesses the ability to open its jaw very wide. This, along with its large size, allows it to prey on smaller seal species such as the Antarctic fur seal and the crabeater seal. Leopard seals also regularly eat penguins and squid.
