VLeopard  Print Hair-On Leather Full Pure Brazilian Skin Rug CarpetPRODUCT ID: HSHS587SHAPE: Full Hide.  LENGTH: 87 inches.  WIDTH: 81 inches.LEATHER: Hair-On Cowhide.  BASE: Natural Leather.  PATTERNS: Leopard Stripes Stencil.   TO SEE OTHER COLORS AND SIZES OF THIS TYPE OF RUG, PLEASE CLICK HERE!Leopard  print rugs are one of the most popular "Stencilled" animal print cowhides that will surely accent your decor with that exotic, natural look of Leopard stripes. The base of the the rug is left natural and un-altered so that you may feel the real texture and thickness of the leather.  It can be used on the walls as wall hangings or on the floor as rugs. Although we have them in various sizes and shades, we take extra effort to take pictures of every single rug we sell - something rarely found in other sellers. You will be getting the exact piece you are seeing in the picture. As such, the shades and size will be as specified. These hides are hand-selected that have the minimum amount of shading, speckling and patching.All of our cowhides are sourced from some of the best tanneries around the world, the primary source being from Argentina. These are some of the finest qualities you will find and we are proud to claim that we are probably the cheapest in price and best in quality and design, be it online or in any brick and mortar store. The cowhides we select are naturally very supple and soft unlike the commonly available ones in the market. In addition, our tanning process is based on the rarely used eco-friendly technique where all checmicals are 100% tested for safety and approved for home decor use. They do not have any unpleasant smell that many other cowhide products commonly have. It is to be noted that the rug has real Cowhide hairs on it and so extra care has to be taken if spread on the floor having high traffic. Special care also needs to be taken in cleaning. Soft, dry and light brushing is the perfect way of cleaning it. With proper care, this is a perfect home decor piece that will not diminish in its rich look even after years of use.Past ReviewsPayment TermsShipping TermsReturn PoliciesCustomer ServicesCommentFromDate / TimeItem #perfectSeller 2011nektarios( 6  ) 11/22/2011 9:04:08 PM250914093313EXSELENTSeller 2011nektarios( 6  ) 11/22/2011 5:30:28 PM230689579237EXSELENDSeller 2011nektarios( 6  ) 11/22/2011 5:29:25 PM250913139561GREAT WILL GET MORESeller snoweyday( 105  ) 11/20/2011 4:06:12 AM250812854602Amazing cowhide rug.
