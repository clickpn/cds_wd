VAfrican Leopard Skull - The African leopard once ranged throughout most of Asia. Today, the largest populations are found in much of Africa. Leopards are famous for their ability to go undetected due to their stealth and patterned camouflage. Leopards live in highly variable habitats including tropical forests, swamps, grasslands, and mountains. Leopards primarily feed on monkeys, small gazelle, rabbits and the occasional domestic goat or pig.
