It is an extremelyhard nut - much harder than real ivory - and its carving is quite difficult. It is also called the TAGUA nut or IVORY nut. It is a seed that comes from the Phytelephas Macrocarpa palm tree that only grows in the tropical rainforests of the South American Pacific coasts. Etymologically, the term Phytelephas Macrocarpa is derived from the Greek phyton: plant and elephas: elephant, making reference to the ivory.For over 200 years Tagua has been chosen by ivory carvers for the production of artifacts and traditional games. In the late 1800s this ivory nut was used to make some of the finest buttons in the clothing industry. Tagua is a commodity of global importance and artisans choose it to manufacture articles of utility and luxury. This vegetable ivory nut (Tagua)has become more popular again recently as an ethical and sustainable alternative to the sourcing of mammal ivory such as that from elephants, whales, walrus and other species. More recently, the use of vegetable ivory had virtually disappeared with the increased popularity and reduced costs of plastics. It is still popular with carvers in Japan, but increasingly rare. Ecuador has maintained the industry to a certain extent, but it remains relatively latent. Today, however, vegetable ivory has become increasingly important as the only natural alternative to mammal ivory in the fashion and textile industries.The Tagua nut has been used for hundreds of years to make dice, dominoes, carvings, chess pieces, cane and umbrella handles andreligious figurines, but the nuts are great productsfor confection of beautiful accessories and so pretty and unique pieces of jewelry.NO RESERVE - Low starting price for an EXTREMELY RARE and beautiful item !!!
